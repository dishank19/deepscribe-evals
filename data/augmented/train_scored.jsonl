Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs.

They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle.

I see that you are a 60-year-old African American male and currently asymptomatic. I also noticed that your 62-year-old brother had prostate cancer and was successfully treated with radiation. Is that correct?\nPatient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.\nPatient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?\nDoctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.\nPatient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?\nDoctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.\nPatient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?\nDoctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.\nPatient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?\nDoctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.\nPatient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.\nDoctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.\nPatient D: Thank you, doc.

I also had an episode of presyncope about 2 weeks ago but didn't get any further evaluation.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have any family history of diseases or any past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, or sudden cardiac death?\nPatient: No, I don't have any family history of diseases, and I haven't had any of those conditions myself either.

You also have some distinct skeletal features, like enlargement of the tongue and lip, as well as large hands and feet. \nPatient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed that too.\nDoctor: During the cardiac auscultation, we observed irregular premature beats, a pathological third heart sound, and a systolic murmur over the apex and aortic area. We also noted bilateral extensive borders of cardiac dullness. Your physiological reflexes are present without any pathology. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with a wide QRS duration of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Based on this, your condition is classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III–IV.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't know it was that serious.\nDoctor: On admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a pituitary macroadenoma. Given your symptoms, we also ran blood tests for myocardial injury markers, which revealed an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level of 740 pg/ml, indicating cardiac failure.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, hormone laboratory tests demonstrated excessive secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1.

Can you tell me what you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Hi, I've been suffering from right ankle swelling since I was 7 years old. There's no pain and no limitation of movement, but it's really annoying.\nDoctor: I see. What have you done to manage the swelling?\nPatient: Well, I usually have a puncture and drainage of the joint when it swells up.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?\nPatient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.\nDoctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?\nPatient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.\nDoctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?\nPatient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.\nDoctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.\nDoctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/μL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL. Your antinuclear antibody was borderline, but autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?\nDoctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?\nDoctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

How long did it take for the emergency medical service to arrive?\nPatient: It took them around 10 minutes to get there after my husband started CPR.\nDoctor: During that time, you were given two doses of epinephrine before achieving return of spontaneous circulation. You were then taken to an outside hospital. At the hospital, you were hypotensive with a blood pressure of 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor infusion. You also had expiratory wheezing, needing continuous nebulizer treatment. Your initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of < 6.8, carbon dioxide of 130 mmHg, and oxygen of 331 mmHg.\nPatient: Yes, they gave me continuous albuterol treatments and made adjustments to the ventilator.\nDoctor: After those treatments, your repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 6.81, PaCO2 of 138 mmHg, and PaO2 of 262 mmHg. On examination, you were comatose with fixed and dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. You were then transferred to our facility for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\nPatient: Okay, so what happened when I arrived here?\nDoctor: Upon arrival, we sedated and paralyzed you to optimize ventilation and oxygenation prior to ECMO. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head, which showed diffuse cerebral edema, indicating a severe anoxic brain injury.\nPatient: Oh no, what was done after that?\nDoctor: You were evaluated by our neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) team. They administered mannitol (100 g) and 23.4% (30 cc) to help with the cerebral edema, but there was no change in your neurological examination. We initiated veno-venous (V-V) ECMO with a flow of 4 LPM, speed of 3215 RPM, and FiO2 of 100% to support your oxygenation.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now, doc?\nDoctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust the ECMO settings as needed. Our team will also provide any necessary treatments and interventions to help improve your neurological function.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.

Any postpartum complications?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been doing well since the delivery. No complications, thankfully.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. As part of our ongoing study on \"Vaginal delivery after caesarean section\", you underwent a saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The results showed a small indentation in your caesarean scar, and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ). \nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my current pregnancy?\nDoctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.\nDoctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.\nPatient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.\nDoctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.\nPatient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?\nDoctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?\nDoctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.\nPatient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Can you tell me more about these symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been experiencing numbness and paralysis recently, and it's been affecting my daily activities.\nDoctor: I understand. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a tumor mass around the vertebral bodies. It's invading the spinal canal from L2 through L4 and compressing the dura mater. This could be the cause of your symptoms.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: We also found multiple abnormal signals within the T12, L3-5 vertebral bodies. We performed a systemic examination using 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), which showed multiple nodular FDG uptakes in the vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, and femur.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means there are multiple areas in your body with abnormal cell activity. We conducted needle biopsies of the L5 vertebra, but found no sign of tumor cells. Your cerebrospinal-fluid examinations were normal as well. To better understand the tumor, we performed partial excision of the tumor mass through a surgical procedure.\nPatient: And what did you find?\nDoctor: Microscopic examination revealed mononuclear tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm infiltrating between the bone trabeculae. The tumor cells were positive for CD33 and CD68, and negative for CD3, CD20, CD34, and CD56, which confirmed the diagnosis of MS.\nPatient: So, I have MS?\nDoctor: Yes, based on these findings and laboratory tests, you've been diagnosed with de novo MS. Your blood count and coagulation tests showed no abnormalities, and there was no sign of leukemia in your bone marrow. Cytogenetic examination revealed 46, XY and was negative for translocation of PML/RARα and other balanced translocations routinely searched for in AML patients by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nPatient: What's the next step for my treatment?\nDoctor: We initially treated you with local irradiation to the vertebral tumor, which immediately resolved your neurological symptoms. Additionally, we treated you with daunorubicin and cytarabine, followed by a course of high-dose cytarabine.\nPatient: Did the treatment work?\nDoctor: At the end of chemotherapy, the PET/CT showed no abnormal uptake, which is a good sign. However, four months later, the MS relapsed as multiple tumors involving the right side of your body.\nPatient: Oh no, what do we do now?\nDoctor: We will need to discuss further treatment options and closely monitor your condition.

In your past medical history, you were free of symptoms and had no chronic disease, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And none of your family members had lung disease or were smokers, correct?\nPatient: Yes, no one in my family has lung disease or smokes.\nDoctor: At admission, your vital signs were within normal limits except for a high respiratory rate of 45 per minute. Your total blood count, liver, and renal function tests were also unremarkable. During your physical examination, we noticed a 2x1 cm palpable mass on the right side of your neck. Did you notice this mass before?\nPatient: No, I didn't know about it.\nDoctor: A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest revealed bilateral air cysts in varying sizes with a ground glass appearance. Pneumothorax was also detected. We performed a biopsy on the neck mass and diagnosed you with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) confined to the right salivary gland. The histopathologic features included polymorphonuclear leukocytes and atypical histocytes with oval nucleus and pale granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining with CD1a and S100 were positive.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We started you on chemotherapy including vinblastine and prednisone. However, during follow-up, your pneumothorax persisted, and we had to insert another chest tube on the left side. Unfortunately, you were unresponsive to medical treatment 2 weeks after admission.\nPatient: So, what happened next?\nDoctor: We performed a chemical pleurodesis with 2 cc of talc through the tube thoracostomy. No intrapleural analgesics were used. The tube was clamped for 1 hour and unclamped at the end of the procedure. During the clamped period, you were recommended to rotate on each side for 10 minutes.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: After 10 days of follow-up, you developed bilateral pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema despite the tube thoracostomy. We then performed a thoracoscopic bullae excision with pleural decortication 10 days after the talc pleurodesis.\nPatient: What did the evaluation show?\nDoctor: The histopathological evaluation of pleural biopsies obtained by thoracoscopy revealed inflammation and foreign bodies, which were talc particles. No lung biopsy was sampled during the bullae excision.\nPatient: So, what happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgical excision of subpleural bullae, you were symptom-free for only 1 week.

My heart has been feeling weak and I've had trouble catching my breath.\nDoctor: I see. You had a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D; Medtronic® Viva XT CRT-D; AAI 60) implanted 7 years ago. This was to help with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Later, as a bridge to transplantation, you had a HeartMate II® LVAD implanted 4 years ago. No arrhythmia developed immediately after LVAD implantation, so your CRT-D shock therapy was turned off. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your transthoracic echocardiographic study at the time of LVAD implantation showed a significant decrease in left ventricular (LV) contractility (ejection fraction; 13%), dilation of the left ventricle (51 mm in diastole), and trivial aortic regurgitation (AR) without opening of the aortic valve. However, your right ventricular (RV) contraction had maintained well relatively (RV fractional area change; 33%). \nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: Eight months after LVAD implantation, you developed palpitations and were admitted to our hospital due to repeated VAs necessitating electrical defibrillation. Your echocardiography showed the left ventricle diameter did not change, but the right ventricle volume was slightly enlarged. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I had to come in because of those palpitations.\nDoctor: You were treated with various anti-arrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, nifekalant, mexiletine, and lidocain, but your condition progressed to sustained VF. This led to a hemodynamic compromise and liver congestion. We then tried a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, diuretics, and rotation speed optimization (from 8800 to 9600 rpm). These interventions reduced organ dysfunction, suggesting that minimum-required perfusion to vital organs was maintained even under sustained VF. You were followed up on an outpatient basis after that. Does that sound right?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: About 2 years after the development of sustained VF, paroxysmal AF was detected on the monitoring records of your CRT-D, with a gradually increasing frequency. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: After 3 years of sustained VF, you were readmitted to our hospital due to worsening of symptoms associated with right heart failure and liver congestion. Your total bilirubin level was elevated. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling worse lately, and I'm really worried about my condition.\nDoctor: I understand your concern. We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed to help manage your symptoms.

What symptoms have you been experiencing?\nPatient: I've been having fever, headache, myalgia, chest pain, dry cough, dizziness, asthenia, dyspnea, acute respiratory failure, and back pain.\nDoctor: I see. We have admitted you to the hospital and conducted a laboratory test. The results revealed hemoconcentration (47.1%), thrombocytopenia (37,000/mm3), leukocytosis (22,180/mm3), increased urea and creatinine (72.56 mg/dL and 1.87 mg/dL, respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (102.4 IU), and alanine aminotransferase (57.14 IU). Unfortunately, we were not able to perform a chest X-ray.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What does all that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate that you may have an infection. The analysis of the serum sample collected on the seventh day of the disease showed the presence of anti-hantavirus IgM antibodies, with negative IgG. We detected hantavirus Castelo dos Sonhos by RT-PCR.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We have started a therapeutic strategy based on antibiotics associated with hemodynamic and respiratory support to treat your illness.\nPatient: I hope it helps.\nDoctor: We will do our best to help you recover. Unfortunately, the patient died nine days after the onset of the illness.\n[The patient's family enters the conversation]\nFamily member: Doctor, what happened? \nDoctor: I'm sorry for your loss. Despite our efforts with the therapeutic strategy, the patient's condition did not improve. \nFamily member: What will you do now?\nDoctor: After the first occurrence of HPS in miners, we carried out a study to estimate the prevalence of anti-hantavirus antibodies in 112 samples previously collected from a population living in a mining area in the Três Fronteiras district in the city of Colniza, Mato Grosso. These serum samples were stored in the Malaria Biorepository of the University Hospital Júlio Muller following a malaria survey conducted in 2012.\nFamily member: Why are you using those samples?\nDoctor: We are using these samples due to the physiogeographical and population similarities between this gold mining area and the area where the two fatal HPS cases, including your loved one, were identified. These two mining areas, even if geographically distant, are comparable because they are located in the Amazon biome and have the same environmental modifications from the garimpo.\nFamily member: Thank you for the information, Doctor.

I needed to write down everything to not forget things. I used to only use notes for shopping, but now it's for everything.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any difficulties with spatial orientation, sleep, appetite, or motivation?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any difficulties with those things.\nDoctor: Alright.

{"id": "19", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're currently 9 weeks pregnant through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Can you tell me about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, I had one previous pregnancy with a normal delivery. I also have a history of asthma, but no history of blood cell transfusion or medication, except for the antibiotic cephem during ICSI to prevent infection.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. At your first visit, we administered a blood test which revealed that you are D-antigen-positive and irregular antibody-negative. Your hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dl. Now, at 28 weeks of gestation, a recent blood test showed acute macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 108.1 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 35.3 pg. We performed a detailed examination to determine the reason for these results.\nPatient: Oh wow, that sounds concerning. What could be causing this anemia?\nDoctor: We considered several possibilities including Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but these were unlikely. Systemic lupus erythematosus is reported as a disease that causes anemia, but it was also unlikely because a test for anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Your C3, C4, and erythrocyte-binding IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were also normal. We then suspected the presence of hemolytic anemia and performed several additional examinations.\nPatient: So, what were the results of those additional examinations?\nDoctor: We found an increase of reticulocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a marked decrease of haptoglobin (<10 mg/dl). Upon further examination of the LDH fractions, we observed that LDH1 and LDH2 were markedly increased. Your urine was negative for hemoglobin. These results strongly suggest the presence of hemolysis.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me and my baby?\nDoctor: It means that your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than it can produce them, causing anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for anti-IgG and negative for anti-C3d, while the indirect antiglobulin test was negative. There was no corresponding medical history or symptoms of infection that could have contributed to the observed hemolytic anemia. A blood test for cold agglutinins was also negative.\nPatient: What should I do now? Are there any treatments or precautions I need to take?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor your condition and may prescribe medication to manage the anemia. It's important to attend all your prenatal appointments, and we'll provide you with further guidance and recommendations as needed.

Your intraocular pressures are 17 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. Unfortunately, the fundus in your left eye is invisible due to massive VH (Fig. a). We'll also check your blood pressure and perform some laboratory tests, including coagulating factors.\n*After tests*\nDoctor: Your blood pressure and laboratory test results are normal. Let's monitor your condition for a couple of weeks and see if there are any improvements.\n*2 weeks later*\nPatient: My vision seems to be a bit better now.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. The VH has partially decreased, and your BCVA has improved to 0.4 logMAR in the left eye. No cause of VH other than the PHA was found (Fig. b). We'll perform a slit-lamp examination to further investigate.\n*After slit-lamp examination*\nDoctor: The examination demonstrated a Mittendorf's dot located in the inferior nasal quadrant of the posterior lens capsule in your left eye (Fig. ). We'll also perform optical coherence tomography (OCT) to get a better understanding of the issue.\n*After OCT*\nDoctor: OCT showed a hyporeflective tubular structure of the PHA and an elevated tissue structure of the optic nerve, which is Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ). However, OCT angiography could not demonstrate the active blood flow of the PHA due to technical limitations. We were able to find the blood flow in the Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: Fortunately, the VH spontaneously disappeared after 2 months, and no serious disorders have been observed in your left eye during the follow-up period.

Your systolic blood pressure was 240 mmHg, and your diastolic blood pressure was 110 mmHg. Can you confirm that?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: A brain and chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. It showed no findings in your brain and alveoral hemorrhage in your chest. You also underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which revealed mild to moderate mitral valve regurgitation and prolapse. Your blood tests were within normal rates.

Have you had any recent surgery or trauma that might be related to this?\nPatient: No, there's been no surgery or trauma.\nDoctor: Alright, let's start by performing a thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scan to take a closer look. *After the scan* The CT scan revealed an ovoid soft tissue mass in the left posterior costophrenic angle, measuring about 4.3 cm×2.6 cm×5.8 cm.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We'll need to resect the mass under VATS. Intraoperatively, we found that the mass was closely located to the diaphragm. Initially, it was diagnosed as a neurogenic tumor of the mediastinum, but the final pathology showed it was a bronchogenic cyst.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step?\nDoctor: The operative course was uneventful, and we inserted a chest tube through the camera port at the 7th intercostals space midaxillary line. Nothing special was noted on the first day after surgery, but on the second day, you experienced two episodes of hypotension.\nPatient: Yeah, I remember feeling really weak.\nDoctor: We treated the hypotension with fluid expansion since there was no evidence of active bleeding from the chest tube. However, you suddenly presented with hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest, evident by a gush of blood from the chest tube.\nPatient: That was so scary!\nDoctor: We performed resuscitation and stabilization, and then you underwent emergent thoracotomy. After clearing the blood clots inside the chest, we found that the pericardium was distended by accumulated blood. Further inspection revealed active bleeding coming from a 3 mm hole on the pericardium.\nPatient: Oh my god...\nDoctor: We opened the pericardium to relieve the cardiac tamponade. The bleeding was found to be originating from an injured obtuse marginal artery of the left coronary artery. Because the injury was at the distal end of the obtuse marginal artery, we directly closed it with 4-0 prolene.\nPatient: So, is everything okay now?\nDoctor: Yes, you were successfully weaned from the ventilator on the 2nd postoperative day and finally discharged from the hospital.

Have you had any prior risk factors for coronary artery disease?\nPatient: No, I've been healthy and never had any issues before.\nDoctor: Alright, let's start with some tests. We'll check your hemoglobin level and perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest and abdomen. We'll also do an electrocardiogram (EKG) and check your troponin levels to assess your heart function.\nPatient: Sure, doc.\n*After tests*\nDoctor: Your test results are in. Your hemoglobin level is 8.7 g/dl, and the CT scan revealed a splenic hematoma. Your EKG and troponin levels were normal at the time of admission. We'll discharge you with pain medications, and you should return if symptoms persist.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor.\n*Two weeks later*\nPatient: Doctor, I've been experiencing dyspneic spells and dizziness lately.\nDoctor: Let's run some more tests, including checking your troponin levels again and performing a new EKG.\n*After tests*\nDoctor: Your troponin level has elevated to 0.049 ug/L, peaking at 3 ug/L over the next 15 hours. Your hemoglobin level is stable at 8 g/dL, and your thyroid stimulating hormone and B-type natriuretic peptide are normal. There's no acute process seen on cardiopulmonary imaging. The initial EKG shows a first-degree heart block during this presentation.\nPatient: What does that mean, doc?\nDoctor: We performed a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no valvular or wall motion abnormalities. However, a repeat EKG three hours later demonstrated progression to a second-degree (Mobitz type 1) atrioventricular heart block (AVB).\nPatient: Oh no, is that serious?\nDoctor: A radionuclide stress test indicated a small and fixed defect of mild severity in the mid-anteroseptal and apical anterior location, consistent with myocardial infarction. As your symptoms persisted, we performed another EKG six hours later, which showed a complete heart block.\nPatient: What can be done about this?\nDoctor: We managed this urgently with a successful dual-chamber pacemaker, which should help resolve your symptoms and normalize your troponin levels.

Has he been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications?\nPatient's mother: He has no prior medical history and hasn't been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications.\nDoctor: Is there any family history of diabetes insipidus?\nPatient's mother: No, there's no family history of diabetes insipidus.\nDoctor: I noticed in his social history that you returned to work prior to the onset of symptoms. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's mother: Yes, I started working again shortly before his symptoms began.\nDoctor: I see. Now, for the evaluation done, his serum sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine level, insulin-like growth factor, cortisol, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prolactin were all normal. His random arginine vasopressin level was 1.4 pg/mL, which is within the normal range of 1–13.3 pg/mL, and his random urine osmolality was 285 mOsm/kg.\nDoctor: A head MRI did not reveal any pituitary or other intracranial pathologies, and a renal ultrasound showed a right kidney with a duplicated collecting system with mild prominence of the lower pole of the renal pelvis. An informal water deprivation test was conducted at home. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's mother: Yes, we were instructed to limit his water intake at home overnight and return for laboratory evaluation in the morning. His urine osmolality was 683 mOsm/kg after 12 hours of water deprivation. But at the end of the water deprivation, I had to give him water to stimulate diuresis. No serum osmolality or sodium levels were collected.\nDoctor: Based on this, your son was diagnosed with partial diabetes insipidus and started on oral desmopressin (DDAVP). I see that the dose of DDAVP was titrated up to 0.2 mg twice daily for effect. How has he been since starting this medication?\nPatient's mother: His polyuria and polydipsia have resolved after starting the medication, and he's been doing much better.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

Can you tell me more about his symptoms?\nParent: Yes, he was struggling to breathe and kept retching. It was quite distressing for him.\nDoctor: I understand. The initial chest X-ray at the outside hospital showed a left-sided tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and the suspicion of bowel loops in the left lower hemithorax. That's why the patient was transferred to our institution for further examination and treatment.\nParent: I see. What happened after he was admitted here?\nDoctor: On admission, he showed severe dyspnea, had a temperature of 39.5°C, and tachycardia of 200/min. To address his breathing issue, we performed an immediate endotracheal intubation.\nParent: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it was necessary to stabilize his condition. After that, we performed a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan which confirmed a left-sided enterothorax with mediastinal shift. We then inserted a left-sided chest tube to drain the fluid that was initially considered to be old blood.\nParent: What were the next steps?\nDoctor: Due to the sudden onset of symptoms and a normal chest X-ray from the age of 1 year, we considered a diaphragmatic rupture as a differential diagnosis. So, we took your boy to the operation room (OR) immediately for a diagnostic laparoscopy.\nParent: What did you find during the operation?\nDoctor: We detected a left-sided Bochdalek hernia with herniation of the small intestine, spleen, and stomach into the chest. Bile-stained fluid was found in the thorax and abdomen. We repositioned the herniated organs back into the abdomen and discovered a gastric perforation at the lesser curvature, which explained the pneumothorax he was experiencing.\nParent: Oh no, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We decided that the gastric perforation couldn't be closed safely laparoscopically, so we performed a conversion to laparotomy. We closed the gastric perforation and repaired the diaphragmatic hernia with interrupted stitches.\nParent: How did he recover after the surgery?\nDoctor: After extubation on the fourth postoperative day, a retrovesical abscess was detected and drained 30 days after the surgery. Due to gastroparesis, your boy showed a prolonged recovery and was finally discharged after 4 to 5 weeks in good condition.\nParent: I'm glad he recovered well. How is he doing now?\nDoctor: After a follow-up of 2 years, your boy is asymptomatic and doing well. We will continue monitoring his progress, but so far, everything looks good.\nParent: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything so clearly and taking care of our son.

{"id": "28", "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there! I see that you are a 52-year-old female with no significant past medical history. What brings you here today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing some left lower quadrant abdominal pain lately.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your family history a bit. I see that your brother had lung cancer at the age of 62 years and had a risk factor of chronic smoking. Your paternal grandmother had bilateral synchronous breast cancer at 80, and your grandfather had prostate cancer at 79. Is there any family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer?\nPatient: No, there's no family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer that I'm aware of.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. We'll need to perform a physical examination and a CT scan of your abdomen to identify any issues. \n(After the examination and CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan of your abdomen showed an obstructed rectosigmoid mass. We then performed a colonoscopy which revealed a recto sigmoid mass measuring 4.5 × 6.5 cm, located 18 cm from the anal verge. The biopsy results indicate a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about the CT scan of the chest? Did it show any distant metastases?\nDoctor: Fortunately, the CT scan of the chest and abdomen did not show any evidence of distant metastases. We went ahead with a laparoscopic rectosigmoid and local lymph node resection with a left end colostomy. The pathology showed an invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration beyond the muscularis propria into subserosal tissue.\nDoctor: There were high-risk features, including lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Six of the twenty-eight lymph nodes we analyzed were positive for adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: So what does all this mean for me? \nDoctor: After your colectomy, we sent the initial surgical specimen for analysis with next-generation sequencing. The tumor mutations included BRIP1 P619Fs*20, TP53 S2151, splice site 783-2A > G, CDK8 amplification was equivocal, and APC E 1295*. Your Lynch syndrome screen by immunohistochemistry (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins) showed normal expression in pathological tissue. There were no reportable alterations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF.\nPatient: I had colon cancer at such a young age with no family history. Can we do an evaluation of a possible hereditary predisposition?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed an initial testing with a commercially available 17-gene colon cancer risk panel, and the results were negative. However, we proposed additional germline testing for the BRIP1 gene mutation based on the high allele frequency of the BRIP1 mutation found in your tumor.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. It is important for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep an eye on any new symptoms that may arise. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n", "gold_soap": {"S": "A 52-year-old female presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain.

{"id": "29", "transcript": "Doctor: Hi, I see that you've been referred to our department because of several weeks of symptoms like chills, fever, malaise, fatigue, and recurrent tumble despite antibiotic therapy. Can you tell me more about it?\nPatient: Yes, I was treated with antibiotics for about two weeks in another hospital before coming here. The symptoms just didn't go away.\nDoctor: I understand. You also had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months ago, right?\nPatient: Yes, I had a gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and an esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency during that surgery.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. When you initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at your family doctor, you were admitted to another hospital. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When you were admitted, your inflammation parameters increased despite antibiotic therapy, and you had a recurrent fever. That's when your medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam. Can you confirm that?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: We took three independent sets of peripheral blood cultures before starting the changed antibiotic, and all three sets showed Lactobacillus species. Have you been taking any probiotics recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't taken any probiotics.\nDoctor: We suspected endocarditis because of bacteremia with Lactobacillus, recurrent symptoms, worsening of your condition, and persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment. When you were admitted here, you were febrile with a temperature of 38.3°C, somnolent, and complained of generalized fatigue and malaise. Your heart rate was 85 bpm, and your blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's how I felt.\nDoctor: Our clinical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at the apex, and we found no painful haemorrhagic spots on your left hand fingertips, which are known as Janeway lesions. Lung auscultation and chest X-ray showed no anomalies. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\nDoctor: We performed some laboratory studies that showed you have normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl and MCV of 85.0 fl. Your white blood cell count was regular at 8,960/µl, but you had a reduced platelet count of 123,000/µl, elevated C-reactive protein of 12.6 mg/dl, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 310 U/l. \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: To further investigate, we performed a transesophageal echocardiogram. It showed degenerative changes of the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation and small endocarditis vegetation. \nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It's crucial to follow up with us regularly to ensure your symptoms are managed and to prevent any complications from developing. We'll keep you informed about any changes in your condition and provide the necessary guidance.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate that.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been feeling nervous and afraid for no apparent reason for the past 3 months. I'm scared to leave the house, and I've been really upset and sensitive. I even cry sometimes.\nDoctor: I understand, and how has your walking been?\nPatient: Not great, I need to put my hands on the wall at home to prevent falling. My steps are really small.\nDoctor: I see. Have you had any history of mental illness before these symptoms developed?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: Alright. I noticed that you were hospitalized in a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission and diagnosed with GAD. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: You were prescribed paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d) during that time. How did your symptoms improve after taking these medications?\nPatient: They did improve for a while, and I was discharged from the hospital. I took the medications regularly as instructed.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, it seems that you experienced a relapse half a month prior to your admission at our hospital. Can you describe the symptoms you had during this relapse?\nPatient: I started feeling more anxious and fearful again. My walking got worse, I didn't want to leave my home, and I spoke less. I also became slow to respond and started having urinary incontinence. I couldn't take care of myself independently anymore.\nDoctor: I see. I also noticed that you were diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years ago. Have you had any other comorbidities?\nPatient: No, just the diabetes.\nDoctor: And there are no abnormalities in your personal history, menstrual history, marriage, or childbirth history, correct?\nPatient: That's right, everything else is normal.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, during your physical examination after admission, we found that your limb muscle strength and tone were normal, as were your finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg's sign.

{"id": "32", "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand your 8-month-old female infant had a coronary reimplantation at age 3 months for ALCAPA. How has she been since the surgery?\nPatient's parent: She seemed to be doing better at first, but lately, she's been having some issues.\nDoctor: I see. What kind of issues has she been experiencing?\nPatient's parent: She's been having trouble breathing, and she hasn't been growing as expected.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Her postsurgical ejection fraction did show early improvement, but it seems there has been some subsequent deterioration. We performed a diagnostic left heart catheterization as part of a heart transplant evaluation and discovered severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. This could be the reason for her symptoms.\nPatient's parent: Oh no, that sounds serious. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We've decided to refer her for PCI of the left main coronary artery to relieve her heart failure and preempt the need for a heart transplant. Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function.\nPatient's parent: Okay, so what does the procedure involve?\nDoctor: A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram were performed, which demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. The procedure was carried out in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology teams.\nPatient's parent: That sounds like a lot of experts involved. How was the procedure done?\nDoctor: We used general anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant's aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion.\nPatient's parent: And what happened next?\nDoctor: Since the infant's left main coronary artery was small but expected to grow with age, we implanted a somewhat larger (3.0 × 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. However, a post-stent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation, missing the ostium and leaving residual stenosis of the LMCA origin.\nPatient's parent: Oh dear, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We then placed a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent into the LMCA ostium, overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters into the aorta proximally. This should help improve the blood flow in her heart.\nPatient's parent: I hope that helps her. What should we expect in terms of recovery and follow-up?\nDoctor: She will need close monitoring to ensure the stents are functioning properly and her heart function improves. We will schedule regular follow-up appointments and echocardiograms to track her progress. If you notice any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us.\nPatient's parent: Thank you, Dr. Smith.

You've been referred to our emergency department due to right-sided chest pain and mild dyspnea within 48 hours of onset of menses. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I've had two previous episodes of catamenial pneumothorax, with the last one happening six months ago.\nDoctor: I see. Have you ever had a history of endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, or dyspareunia?\nPatient: No, I've never experienced any of those symptoms.\nDoctor: Okay. We performed an initial examination, which included a chest X-ray that revealed a right pneumothorax. To confirm the diagnosis, we also conducted a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. \nPatient: Hmm, I see. What did the CT scan show?\nDoctor: The CT scan confirmed the presence of a right pneumothorax. We then performed Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) to treat the issue.\nPatient: What did you find during the VATS procedure?\nDoctor: During VATS, we discovered several diaphragmatic fenestrations that communicated with the abdominal cavity. Interestingly, your liver had herniated through these fenestrations. We resected the involved area and repaired the diaphragm using a nonabsorbable interrupted suture.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't expect that. What did the pathologic report say?\nDoctor: The pathologic report confirmed that you had diaphragmatic endometriosis. However, we managed to treat it effectively during the VATS procedure.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: You underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) 4 months after the surgery, and I'm pleased to inform you that you became pregnant.\nPatient: That's wonderful news! How is my pregnancy going?\nDoctor: You are now at 20-weeks into a normal pregnancy and remain asymptomatic, which means everything is going well so far.\nPatient: I'm so relieved to hear that.

It looks like you previously received four days of cefixime and azithromycin treatment. Have you had any recent dental treatment, surgery, or drug abuse?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any dental treatment or surgery, and I don't abuse drugs.\nDoctor: That's good to know.

Your urine analysis came back negative for infection. The electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia, and your chest x-ray was normal. We performed a bone marrow aspirate to exclude hematological malignancies.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We've drawn two sets of blood cultures and started you on empirical treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate plus vancomycin. The blood cultures came back positive for gram-positive cocci in chains, which were later identified as streptococcus group A (Streptococcus pyogenes).\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Don't worry, we're addressing the infection. You've been admitted to the Infectious Disease Department, and we've started you on ceftriaxone (2g, twice daily) plus ampicillin (12g/day). We also performed a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which documented moderate mitral regurgitation and multiple mobile filamentous structures attached to the posterior mitral leaflet (PML) of 1.1 cm in length, suggestive of vegetation.\nPatient: Is my heart going to be alright?\nDoctor: Your hemodynamic stability is good, meaning there are no signs of heart failure, and your atrial natriuretic peptide values are normal.

It's been there since I was born, but about a year ago, this new lesion appeared on top of it and has been growing rapidly.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in the nevus, like color, edge irregularity, bleeding, or pain?\nPatient: Yes, the lesion on top of the nevus has changed color, the edges are irregular, and it sometimes bleeds and causes pain.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, I found a 6 x 4-cm erythematous tumor with active bleeding on top of an 8.5 x 3-cm dark brown plate. We also performed a total body photography and digital dermoscopy which documented more than 20 additional melanocytic lesions. We took a biopsy of the lumbosacral lesion, and the histopathological results showed a superficial spreading malignant epithelioid melanoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. The fluorescence in situ hybridization results for the RREB1, MYB, and CCND1 genes, which are common molecular alterations in malignant melanomas, were positive for the new exophytic lesion and negative for the congenital nevus tissue. Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with treatment.\nPatient: What kind of treatment did I undergo?\nDoctor: You underwent a wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and flap reconstruction. The pathological results indicated a Breslow's tumor thickness of 13 mm, Clark Level V, extensive ulceration, mitoses of 10/mm2, negative margins, and sentinel lymph nodes with extensive metastatic involvement. We also performed a lymphadenectomy and obtained 20 lymph nodes, six of which were positive.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these results, you have been diagnosed with stage IIID melanoma, or clinicopathologically T4bN3aM0, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition. The polymerase chain reaction test showed no BRAF mutations.\nPatient: What's the next step for my treatment?\nDoctor: We started you on interferon-α-2b as an adjuvant treatment, but it caused toxicity during the first week of the induction phase.

{"id": "38", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing blurred visual acuity and photopsias in one eye for the past few days.\nDoctor: I see. Were there any symptoms before this visual issue started?\nPatient: Yeah, about 2 days before my vision got blurry, I had flu-like symptoms like fever and headache.\nDoctor: Okay, let's discuss your medical and ocular history. Have you had any previous issues or recent contact with animals, especially cats?\nPatient: No, my medical history is unremarkable and I haven't been around any animals recently.\nDoctor: Alright, we'll need to run some laboratory and imaging tests to determine the cause. Let's start with a complete blood count (CBC) and chest and sinus X-rays.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: Your CBC results and X-rays came back normal. We also tested for syphilis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Bartonella, Histoplasma capsulatum, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara canis, and Borrelia burgdorferi, and all results were negative. Now, let's perform an ocular examination.\n[After the ocular examination]\nDoctor: Your best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left eye. Biomicroscopy of your anterior segment, pupillary reactions, and intraocular pressure are normal in both eyes. We took a color fundus photograph of your left eye, which revealed subtle deep retinal white spots in the posterior pole and around the optic disk.\nDoctor: Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated wreath-like punctate areas of early hyperfluorescence that corresponded to the deep white retinal lesions. Optic disc staining was observed in the late phase of FA. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed several hyperautofluorescent lesions topographically corresponding to the white lesions seen on the color fundus photograph.\nDoctor: We also performed a cross-sectional optical coherence tomography (OCT) which showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the same topography of the spots seen on both FAF and FA. Punctate hypereflective lesions and hyporeflective dots were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and choroid, respectively.\nDoctor: En-face OCT at the level of outer retina demonstrated multiple hyporeflective spots corresponding to the disruption of the EZ seen on the cross-sectional OCT. There was an absence of flow impairment in both the retinal and choroidal vasculature on OCT angiography (OCTA).\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it seems that your visual symptoms are caused by an underlying issue with your retina. We'll need to monitor your condition closely and discuss possible treatment options.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. What should I do for follow-up?\nDoctor: I'd like to see you again in a few weeks to monitor your progress and reevaluate your condition. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please contact our office immediately.\nPatient: Okay, I appreciate your help.

They found something and referred me to your hospital for examination.\nDoctor: I see. Did you have any symptoms or chief complaint before the ultrasound?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any specific complaint. I just went for a routine check-up.\nDoctor: Alright. Let me look at the ultrasound report. It says that they found a retroperitoneal hypoechoic mass measuring 26 × 22 × 18 mm in the perirenal space, at the level of your left renal upper pole. Do you understand what this means?\nPatient: Hmm, not really. Can you explain it to me?\nDoctor: Sure. A retroperitoneal mass is an abnormal growth located behind the peritoneum, which is the lining of the abdominal cavity. In your case, it's in the perirenal space near your left kidney. The size is 26 × 22 × 18 mm, which is relatively small.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So it's a growth near my kidney. Is it something I should be worried about?\nDoctor: At this point, we don't know if it's benign or malignant. We need to perform further tests to determine the nature of the mass and decide the best course of action.\nPatient: Alright. What do I need to do next?\nDoctor: We'll schedule you for a CT scan and possibly a biopsy to get a clearer understanding of the mass. Based on the results, we can discuss treatment options if necessary.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. When can we schedule the CT scan?\nDoctor: We can schedule it for next week. Our staff will contact you with the specific date and time.\nPatient: Great, thank you. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?\nDoctor: No, just continue with your usual activities and avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise.

Your left kidney size was normal, measuring 9.6 cm by 4.8 cm. A Renal Doppler ultrasound confirmed renal artery stenosis with a renal resistive index of 0.58. Are you aware of these results?\nPatient: Yes, I'm aware of those test results.\nDoctor: The percentage of renal artery stenosis in the two branches of your left renal artery was 70% and 75%, respectively, before your first balloon angioplasty. After the procedure, these percentages remained the same. You then underwent a second ballooning and stenting procedure, after which revascularization was achieved. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It's important to note that you have been attending a hypertension clinic and receiving antihypertensive drugs for the past 8 months on a regular basis under close observation. Despite this treatment and care, your blood pressure remained high at 175/110 mmHg. Your attending doctor concluded that this was uncontrolled blood pressure. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what the doctors told me.\nDoctor: Initial imaging indicated left renal artery stenosis, which is why you were referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment. Moving forward, it's crucial for you to continue with your medications and attend follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\nPatient: I understand, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

How about your elbow joints? Are you able to move them normally?\nPatient: Yes, I can move my elbows just fine. I can even touch my shoulder with my hands.\nDoctor: Good to know. Now, let's talk about your feet. Have you noticed any abnormalities there?\nPatient: Yeah, my feet have issues similar to my fingers. My big toes are normal, but the other toes lack creases on the flexor and extensor surfaces of interphalangeal joints, and I can't flex them. Also, the second toes on both feet are a little short.\nDoctor: Okay. Since you're a gravida at 11 weeks of gestation, we won't perform X-ray examinations on you. However, we can look at the results from your mother and sibling for more information. \nPatient: That sounds reasonable.\nDoctor: Your mother, patient I-2, had similar symptoms as you.

{"id": "43", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today?\nPatient's Mother: Hi, Doctor. This is my 5-year-old son. He was born at full term, but he had a history of hypoxia after birth. Recently, he's been having developmental delays and trouble sleeping.\nDoctor: I see. Let's start by discussing the tests he's had so far. I understand he had a urinary organic acid analysis done. Do you remember the results?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, the results showed a high level of GHB.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Has he had any other tests done, such as an EEG or a cerebral MRI?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, both were done at other hospitals, but the results were unclear.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for that information. We conducted a genetic analysis on your son and found a novel homozygous mutation of c.800 T > G (p.V267G) in exon 5, which he inherited from both you and his father. Have you heard of this mutation before?\nPatient's Mother: No, we haven't. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the specific protein, p.V267, is highly conserved among species. The mutation is predicted to be \"probably damaging\" and \"disease causing\" with a score of approximately equal to 1.\nPatient's Mother: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does this mean for my son's development and health?\nDoctor: This mutation could be a contributing factor to his developmental delay and sleep issues. We will need to monitor his progress closely and provide appropriate interventions to help him cope with these challenges.\nPatient's Mother: What kind of interventions can we expect?\nDoctor: We may consider therapies like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy to address his developmental delays. Additionally, we'll work on improving his sleep hygiene and might consider medication if necessary.\nPatient's Mother: Thank you, Doctor. What are the next steps we need to take?\nDoctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your son's progress and adjust interventions as needed. It's important to keep an open line of communication with us to ensure the best possible care for your son.\nPatient's Mother: We will definitely do that.

Have you experienced any other symptoms lately?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had nausea and epigastralgia for the past 2 days.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. We've conducted a few tests and found that your general status was in shock, with concerning vital signs. Unfortunately, you didn't respond well to rehydration.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. Your laboratory findings showed a blood glucose level of 470 mg/dL and an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.2, PCO2 of 25.2 mmHg, HCO3 of 9.9 mEq/L, and PO2 of 169 mmHg with an anion gap of 24.3 mEq/L.

However, there was no obvious sign of perforation or free air in the mediastinum. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with acute esophageal necrosis (AEN).\nPatient: What's the treatment plan, doctor?\nDoctor: We started you on antibiotics, glycemic control, a proton pump inhibitor, and plasmapheresis. You gradually stabilized and were extubated on day 5. However, you still had a fever, and the chest X-ray showed the accumulation of pleural effusion.\nPatient: What happened next?\nDoctor: On day 7, we suspected esophageal perforation due to the significant increase of the right pleural effusion and free air in the mediastinum on a CT scan. We performed an emergency thoracoscopy in a left semiprone position with differential lung ventilation and artificial pneumothorax.\nPatient: That sounds intense.\nDoctor: Yes, it was a necessary procedure. We observed significant pleural effusion with pus and perforation of the esophagus.

{"id": "45", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Your baseline creatinine level is more than 300 μmol/L. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having pain in my lower back and I think it's because of my kidney stones.\nDoctor: That's correct. You presented with bilateral symptomatic large renal stones, and underwent staged stone treatment. Prior to coming to our hospital, you had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion, left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and FURS and laser stone fragmentation for the left renal stones. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. But I didn't get much relief, so I came here for further advice.\nDoctor: I see. We conducted a non-contrast CT scan, which showed multiple bilateral renal stones. In your left kidney, there were 3 stones distributed to middle and lower pole calyces with a stone burden of approximately 3.0 cm. In your right kidney, there were also three stones: two in middle calyces and one in the pelvis, with a total stone burden of 3.2 cm. We then advised you to stop taking aspirin for seven days before undergoing the next treatment. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I followed your advice and stopped taking aspirin.\nDoctor: Great. After that, you underwent simultaneous bilateral FURS and holmium laser lithotripsy, and insertion of bilateral DJS under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The surgical procedure took 125 minutes - 65 minutes for the left side followed by 60 minutes for the right one. We used a similar procedure for both sides. Are you following so far?\nPatient: Yes, I remember the surgery.\nDoctor: During the procedure, we inserted a hydrophilic tip guidewire (Sensor, 0.038 in) and a ureteral access sheath (Inner diameter: 12 Fr, Length: 55 cm). The tip was located approximately at the level of the ureteropelvic junction. We used a Karl Storz flexible ureterorenoscope (8.5 Fr) for the surgery. Do you have any questions about the instruments used?\nPatient: No, I think I understand.\nDoctor: Good. During the procedure, we allowed normal saline to run from the bag, which was approximately 80 cm above the level of your pelvis, without a pump. We observed the outflow of saline from around the scope throughout the procedure. We used laser energy between 1.0–1.2 joules with a frequency ranging between 8 and 12 Hz (short pulses) in both sides. 4200 and 4066 pulses were used in the left and right sides, respectively.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: It's important to monitor your recovery and ensure that the kidney stones have been effectively treated. We'll need to schedule follow-up appointments to check on your progress. If you experience any discomfort or additional symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, I had a history of cerebral infarction, but no remarkable family history.\nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any recent symptoms?\nPatient: I've been having chest pain, clammy sweat, and anorexia lately. I visited a local doctor for AS treatment.\nDoctor: I understand. After the preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), did you experience any new symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I developed chest and back pain and even had a fever.\nDoctor: It seems that the symptoms did not improve, and the computed tomography (CT) revealed prominent mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusion. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed esophageal perforation located 30 cm from the incisors, and gastrografin contrast revealed mediastinum leakage.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the diagnosis?\nDoctor: You've been diagnosed with thoracic esophageal perforation. Because of your age and severe AS, radical thoracotomy surgery for primary repair or resection would be difficult. Instead, we will perform a two-stage surgery and indirect approach, which includes cervical esophagostomy to avoid contamination, gastrostomy for decompression, and jejunostomy for nutrition. Reconstruction will be planned after the mediastinitis and perforation are healed.\nPatient: Alright, what's next?\nDoctor: We performed an emergency operation 32 hours after the TEE under general anesthesia. A 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed through the umbilicus, and four 5-mm ports were placed in the left upper, right upper, left middle, and right middle quadrants. We washed the contaminated mediastinum with saline through the esophageal hiatus from the abdominal cavity side and placed a drainage tube in the mediastinum. Then, we performed gastrostomy and jejunostomy laparoscopically, followed by cervical esophagostomy using a tube.

During your physical examination, I noticed a soft continuous murmur at your left upper chest and basal crackles in both lungs. We conducted a chest radiography which showed mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary congestion. Your ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also performed a transthoracic echocardiography which demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with a markedly dilated left atrium. Your LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. There was an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it's quite unusual. We performed a transesophageal echocardiography which revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We further observed an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. There was also severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: To investigate further, we conducted coronary angiography with a single RCA injection. It revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, which established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome.\nPatient: ALCAPA syndrome? What is that?\nDoctor: ALCAPA syndrome is a rare congenital heart condition. We confirmed a significant left-to-right shunt with a calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow of 1.4.

About a week ago, I was admitted to a local hospital because I had a low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness.\nDoctor: I see. At the local hospital, they treated you with intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a presumptive diagnosis of deep neck infection. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Do you have any medical history we should be aware of?\nPatient: I have hypertension and I've been treated with amlodipine 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily for that.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Do you have any habits like smoking or drinking?\nPatient: I've been a heavy alcohol drinker for 40 years, and I'm a smoker as well.\nDoctor: Alright, let's discuss your current condition.

Your vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.7 °C; blood pressure, 170/100 mmHg; pulse rate, 100 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min. We also did a physical examination. We found mild pale conjunctivae and anicteric sclerae. \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: The neck exam revealed a pulsatile left neck mass, 5 x 5 cm in diameter, with mild tenderness on palpation, and no sign of inflammation. Your neck movement was not limited. The oropharyngeal exam showed bulging of the left posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsil enlargement, causing narrowing of your upper airway. Your thyroid gland was not enlarged, and the neurological exam was normal.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We also performed a skin exam, which revealed multiple ill-defined scaly mild erythematous patches on both legs and dystrophic nails. \nPatient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed those patches.\nDoctor: Your initial laboratory results showed anemia, with a hemoglobin concentration of 9.6 g/L and hematocrit of 28%.

Can you tell me about his medical history, dental history, and family history?\nParent: Well, there's nothing significant in his medical, dental, or family history.\nDoctor: Alright. Let's have a look at the swellings. *Doctor conducts an extraoral examination* There are no specific findings in the extraoral examination. *Doctor conducts an intraoral examination* I can see the presence of soft, sessile papules varying from 2-10 cm in dimension. There are two papules on the right and left side of the lower lip region, and one on the left ventral aspect of the tongue.\nDoctor: Based on the history and clinical features, I'm considering a provisional diagnosis of focal epithelial hyperplasia. We will also need to rule out differential diagnoses such as squamous cell papilloma, condylomataacuminata, mucocele, and focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz–Gorlin syndrome).\nParent: What should we do next, doctor?\nDoctor: First, we'll need to complete a hematological examination before any procedure. This will help us ensure that all parameters are within normal limits.\nParent: Okay, doctor.\n*After the examination*\nDoctor: Good news, all the parameters are within normal limits. We can now proceed with the removal of the lesions under local anesthesia. We'll be using a diode soft tissue laser of 810 nm of 3-3.5W power for 3-60 seconds intermittently.\nParent: Alright, let's do it.\n*After the procedure*\nDoctor: The lesions have been successfully removed and the specimens have been sent for histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation.\nParent: What did the results show?\nDoctor: The histopathology reports revealed benign parakeratotic hyperplastic mucosa with marked papillomatosis and acanthosis. Some of the cells showed isolated perinuclear vacuolization and the presence of occasional mitosoid cells. Importantly, there was no evidence of dysplasia or atypical features of Heck's disease.\nParent: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: The PCR analysis confirmed the presence of HPV subtype 32 as the cause of this condition. Based on the histopathology and PCR results, we can establish a final diagnosis as Heck's disease (focal epithelial hyperplasia).\nParent: How do we treat Heck's disease?\nDoctor: Since the lesions have been removed, we will monitor your child's condition closely.

However, it was complicated by low cardiac output syndrome, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump use. In the postoperative period, your kidney function deteriorated further, necessitating the initiation of renal replacement therapy. \nPatient: Yes, I've been on dialysis for 4 years now.\nDoctor: While being on the active waiting list for kidney transplantation, your lupus has been in remission with complement splits within normal limits (C3–0.93 g/l, C4–0.4 g/l) and ANA negative.

{"id": "54", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I understand that you underwent a Wertheim-Meigs radical hysterectomy as a surgical treatment for cervical carcinoma in 1986. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been struggling with my health for a long time now. My main medical problem has been constant diarrhea for 17 years.\nDoctor: I see. I also noticed that you had a subtotal thyroidectomy in 2000. But let's focus on your diarrhea issue. Have you undergone any diagnostics to identify the cause of your diarrhea?\nPatient: Yes, I had H2-breath tests with lactose, fructose, and sorbitol. They diagnosed me with lactose and fructose malabsorption. I also had a Helicobacter pylori eradication in 2013.\nDoctor: It seems like you've been through a lot. Have you had any rectoscopies or colonoscopies done?\nPatient: I've had several - in 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They found a stenosis in my sigmoid colon, but there were never any histologic aspects of inflammatory bowel disease.\nDoctor: That's correct. A computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis also revealed a long-range concentric thickening of the rectal wall with blurred confinement and fluid imbibition of the perirectal fatty tissue. These endoscopic and radiologic findings, in combination with your clinical history, confirmed the diagnosis of chronic radiation colitis. \nPatient: That's what they told me. I've tried so many treatments to help with my symptoms, but nothing seems to work.\nDoctor: I can see that you've gone through several conservative therapies, including various probiotics such as E. coli strain Nissle 1917, Bifidobacteria (B. bifidum MIMBb75), loperamide, metoclopramid, mesalazine, intestinal tea, psyllium, rice cures, and healing earth. Unfortunately, none of these therapeutic approaches led to a significant and sustained improvement in your symptoms.\nPatient: Yeah, it's been really tough. My quality of life has suffered so much, and I can hardly leave my house because of the diarrhea.\nDoctor: I understand how difficult this must be for you. I see that you've requested to undergo a fecal microbiota therapy to improve your intestinal dysbiosis and hopefully alleviate your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I'm really hoping that this therapy can help me. I'm willing to try anything at this point.\nDoctor: I appreciate your determination. On June 27, 2018, you gave informed consent for this individual therapy trial. We will do our best to help you improve your condition and regain your quality of life.

Your abnormal coagulation profile showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12.4 seconds, INR of 1.2, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 38 seconds. Your elevated alkaline phosphatase was at 160 U/L and creatinine at 1.16 mg/dL. You also had proteinuria with 882 mg/24 h. Do you remember the results of your abdominal ultrasound?\nPatient: Yes, it demonstrated hepatomegaly with the right lobe measuring 21 cm in the craniocaudal dimension.\nDoctor: Correct. And your serum and urine electrophoreses were remarkable for the presence of a paraprotein, immunoglobulin G-lambda. The abdominal fat pad biopsy was unrevealing, but your liver biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemical staining of the liver tissue revealed the presence of lambda light chain.

I've noticed scapular, anterior, and posterior thigh muscle atrophy in your examination. We'll also assess your muscle strength using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.\nPatient: Hmm, alright.\nDoctor: Your assessment revealed weakness of shoulder girdle muscles, with arm flexion and abduction possible against gravity until 90°, without scapular winging, inferior trapezius (2/5), arm extensors (2/5), elbow flexors (3/5), hip flexors (3/5), hip extensors (2/5), knee flexors and extensors (4/5), and dorsal foot extensors (4/5).

{"id": "58", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the emergency department due to urinary retention, weakness, and paresthesia of both lower limbs. Can you tell me a bit more about when these symptoms started?\nPatient: Yes, about two weeks prior to coming here, I started to feel some tingling and weakness in my right lower limb. It came on slowly but then quickly got worse and spread to both of my legs.\nDoctor: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms, such as a rash?\nPatient: Yes, actually, I had a zoster rash that appeared 10 days ago. It was on the right side of my body, around my lower back area.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Upon admission, we conducted a neurological exam and found severe weakness in your lower limbs with a medical research council (MRC) grade of 0/5, while your upper limbs had normal muscle strength. Your ankle and knee jerk reflexes were abolished bilaterally, and Babinski sign was found bilaterally as well. We also noticed decreased sensation to touch with a T2 sensitive level bilaterally, and diminished vibration, temperature, and pinprick sensations in your lower limbs. The rest of your neurological functions appeared unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a hyperintense T2 lesion in your spinal cord, extending from T2 to T11. Gadolinium enhancement was observed on the T1 sequence at the level of T7-T8. No brain or optic nerve lesions were found.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means there's an abnormality in your spinal cord that could be contributing to your symptoms. We also conducted laboratory tests and found elevated white blood cells (WBC = 14100, 72% PMN) and positive IgG VZV serology, which indicates a possible viral infection. Your IgM VZV serology was negative. We tested for other viral and bacterial infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, CMV, HSV, Lyme disease, and syphilis, but those were all negative. Your auto-immune and vitamin workup was unremarkable.\nPatient: So, what's causing my symptoms then?\nDoctor: We believe it might be related to the elevated VZV IgG found in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Your CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (94 cells/uL) and elevated VZV IgG (0.88) with a high VZV IgG index (14). The other tests, including VDRL-TPHA, Wright, and gram tests, as well as bacterial cultures, were all negative.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, history, and test results, we suspect that your symptoms may be caused by a viral infection related to the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). We'll need to discuss the appropriate course of treatment and follow-up requirements to manage your condition.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

The scan shows a normal anatomy survey, including two umbilical arteries. Your past medical history seems unremarkable as well. \nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: At 26 weeks, your estimated fetal weight was 874 grams, which is the 27th percentile. At 29 weeks, it increased to 1306 grams, which is the 26th percentile. However, the ultrasound at 29 weeks revealed a single umbilical artery, which raises suspicion for a pathological process. Have you experienced any complications or unusual symptoms?\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed anything unusual.\nDoctor: We performed a fetal echocardiogram, and fortunately, it was normal. At 31 weeks, the estimated fetal weight was 1349 grams, which is less than the 5th percentile. The Doppler evaluation and biophysical profile were normal at that time.\nPatient: Okay, but what does that mean for my baby?\nDoctor: At 32 weeks, the amniotic fluid index was 10.1 cm, the biophysical profile was 10/10, but the cerebroplacental ratio decreased to 1.083. At 33 weeks, the amniotic fluid index decreased to 2.3 cm. Maternal and fetal Doppler evaluations were normal, except for an abnormal cerebroplacental ratio of 1.08. Fetal heart tracing showed spontaneous prolonged decelerations. \nPatient: That sounds concerning. What should we do?\nDoctor: Secondary to the recurrent prolonged decelerations, we performed a primary cesarean delivery. Your baby, a live male infant, was delivered weighing 1395 grams with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.\nPatient: Oh, I'm relieved to hear that he was born safely.\nDoctor: Yes, the delivery went well. However, the placental pathology showed thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries with necrosis of the medial myocytes. It also showed subendothelial fibrin deposition in stem villous blood vessels, chorionic villous hypervascularity, and a small subchorionic placental infarct. \nPatient: Were there any signs related to thrombosis in my baby?\nDoctor: At birth, your baby showed no signs related to thrombosis. Thrombophilia profiles revealed a severe protein S deficiency with an activity of 13%, but it resolved at two months of age with an activity of 66%. \nPatient: That's a relief. How has my baby been doing since then?\nDoctor: The neonate has had an uneventful clinical course since birth. We will continue to monitor his progress, but everything seems to be going well.\nPatient: Thank you so much, doctor.

Have you sought any medical treatment for this mass?\nPatient's Mother: We initially took her to a traditional healer, but we didn't seek any medical treatment until late 2017.\nDoctor: Can you describe how the mass has affected your daily life?\nPatient: I haven't been able to ambulate for the past 2 years, so I've been bedbound most of the time. It's difficult for me to sit on a wheelchair, and I feel tired because the mass is heavy.\nDoctor: What do you do to find a comfortable position when you're lying down or sleeping?\nPatient: I usually sleep either in a prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below my body. When I lie down flat, I have to flex my hips and knees to be more comfortable.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Can you tell me more about your family medical history?\nPatient's Mother: There's no family history of cancer. She lives with me and her siblings. I am her main caretaker since her father passed away 10 years ago due to a heart attack. She used to attend a special needs school but stopped going in 2015 after the sacral mass developed.\nDoctor: I understand.

Your vital signs are: Blood Pressure 142/90, Pulse Rate 98 beats per minute, and Temperature 37 degrees Celsius. The mass measures 40 cm × 30 cm. \nPatient: What does \"cachexic\" mean, doctor?\nDoctor: Cachexic means that you appear to have lost a significant amount of weight and muscle. Your mother mentioned that your body has been getting thinner over the last 2 months, despite the increase in the size of the sacral mass.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What are the next steps for my treatment?\nDoctor: We will further investigate the mass and discuss the appropriate treatment options for you.

I also have blurry vision, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and progressive memory lapses.\nDoctor: I see.

They diagnosed me with sinusitis and discharged me with antibiotics.\nDoctor: Did you have any fever, nuchal rigidity, or weight loss recently?\nPatient: No, none of those.\nDoctor: When you arrived at the ED, your initial temperature was 98.9°F, with a blood pressure of 94/79 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 79 beats/min. Your respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min with oxygen saturation at 100%. You didn't have any focal neurological deficits and you were alert and oriented.

All results were within normal limits. An Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a chest plain radiograph was normal as well.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: We also did a non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) which revealed no acute hemorrhage or lesion. However, upon reassessment in the ED, you developed a fever of 102°F and became more confused and agitated, with interspersed screaming and yelling.\nPatient: Oh, I don't remember that.\nDoctor: Due to the concern for encephalitis, we performed a lumbar puncture (LP) in the lateral decubitus position to analyze your cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and measure the opening pressure. Unfortunately, you were too agitated to safely obtain a reliable opening pressure.\nPatient: What were the results from the LP?\nDoctor: The results showed a cloudy appearing CSF, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 22. The normal range is 0-5. This indicates an infection, and we will need to start you on appropriate treatment.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Is that correct?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: You were referred to the hospital because of repeated vomiting for 4 days. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, he's been vomiting quite frequently, and it's been concerning us.\nDoctor: I see. Upon examination, I noticed that your child has a round face, full cheeks, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, periorbital fullness, short nose, and an everted lower lip. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms?\nPatient's Parent: No, those are the main ones.\nDoctor: We performed an Enhanced MRI, which showed hydrocephalus. To relieve the symptoms of intracranial hypertension, we performed a shunt surgery. After the surgery, we've been doing MRI and/or computed tomography (CT) assessments every 3 months. Have you noticed any improvements in his symptoms?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, there has been some improvement.\nDoctor: Six months post-shunt MRI revealed the presence of supratentorial ventricular dilatation, brain stem volume reduction, and leptomeningeal enhancement. However, no macroscopic mass was evident at that time. Three months later, another MRI showed a mass of 3 cm diameter in the right frontal lobe.\nPatient's Parent: Oh, that's concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We decided to move forward with surgery to remove the tumor. Although the tumor was completely resected, I'm sorry to inform you that your child passed away 4 months after the surgery.\nPatient's Parent: It's heartbreaking, but we understand.\nDoctor: The pathological evaluation of the CNS lesion revealed that the mass was grossly dark-red to brown and measured (4 × 4 × 2) cm. It was firmly attached to the meninges. Microscopically, the tumor cells had atypical nuclei, obvious nucleoli, an increased karyoplasmic ratio, some mitoses, and remarkable necrosis. They infiltrated the brain parenchyma and were accompanied by melanin deposition.\nPatient's Parent: What were the results of the immunohistopathological evaluation?\nDoctor: The tumor cells positively expressed the antibodies of HMB45, Melan-A, and S100. However, the Ki-67 was positively expressed in 30% of the cells, while P53 was negative.\nPatient's Parent: And what about the cytogenetic study?\nDoctor: The cytogenetic study using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a lack of allelic deletion of P53.

Hmm, it seems to be swollen but without any hematoma. I'll also perform a flexible nasolaryngoscopy to check for any laryngeal edema. Good news, your vocal cords are moving normally, and there's no laryngeal edema.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: We'll also consult the neurology team to rule out an active seizure, since you have epilepsy.

{"id": "66", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia. Can you tell me more about the issues you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having difficulty swallowing lately.\nDoctor: I understand. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and found an elevated lesion 33-36 cm from an incisor tooth accompanied by ulcers at the center of the lesion. It's located in your lower thoracic esophagus (Fig. a). Additionally, we found another submucosal tumor at the anal site of the lower thoracic esophagus, which we believe is intramural metastasis.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Esophagography showed the main tumor lesion on the left antero-lateral wall of your lower esophagus and a submucosal tumor on the other side, causing constriction of the esophagus. The main lesion has good extension on its basal part, indicating that the depth of invasion is at the submucosal level (Fig. b).\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\nDoctor: We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed the protruded tumor lesion to be 3 cm in size. Fortunately, there were no findings of lymph node or distant metastasis (Fig. c).\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: Moreover, a positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan showed an increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the lower thoracic esophagus, but no findings of lymph metastasis (Fig. d).\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We conducted a blood test to check for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC). The results showed that these markers were not elevated.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: A pathological examination of an endoscopic biopsy revealed that you have moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Based on these preoperative analyses, you've been diagnosed with cT2N0M0, cStageII esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\nPatient: Oh, that's unfortunate.\nDoctor: Because you're elderly and have a poor performance status (PS 2), we decided not to proceed with preoperative therapy, postoperative therapy, or lymph node dissection of the superior to mid-mediastinum regions.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Instead, we performed thoracoscopy- and laparoscopy-assisted subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction with the gastric tube. Under thoracoscopy and laparoscopy, we performed subtotal esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction was performed through the retrosternal route.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: The total operation time was 377 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 105 ml.\nPatient: That's not too bad.\nDoctor: We started you on an oral diet 11 days after the operation, and you've been recovering since then.\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling better.

I've been experiencing progressive gait difficulties, rigidity, and weakness in both of my legs since I was 35. I'm 37 now.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I also have urinary urgency with incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\nDoctor: Hmm. Does your family have any history of neurological or endocrinological diseases?\nPatient: No, my family history is negative for those diseases.\nDoctor: Alright. Did you have normal psychomotor development and no learning disabilities growing up?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't report any cognitive symptoms either.\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted a neurological examination. We found mild dysarthria, spastic paraparesis with a wide-based spastic gait. Your deep tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk with a bilateral Achilles clonus and Babinski sign.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which showed multiple congenital brain development defects, including posterior commissure agenesis, right fornix and ipsilateral mammillary body hypoplasia, colpocephaly, right frontal parasagittal cortical thickening, two periventricular nodular heterotopic foci in the right parietal areas, and two venous drainage abnormalities in the left cerebellar hemisphere and right frontal lobe.\nPatient: That's a lot of abnormalities.\nDoctor: Indeed. We also performed a neuropsychological evaluation, which fortunately revealed no abnormalities. Your electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges.\nPatient: Okay, that's a bit of relief.\nDoctor: Additionally, a spinal MRI showed spinal cord atrophy, but electromyography (EMG) did not reveal any abnormal findings.\nPatient: What about other tests?\nDoctor: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) showed increased central conduction time from your right arm and left leg. However, no response was recorded from your right leg. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were absent in both legs, but visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and optic coherence tomography (OCT) were unremarkable.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We used a multi-gene panel for hereditary spastic paraplegia and other motor neuron diseases to further investigate. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the hemizygous mutation c.1394-2A > G in the ABCD1 gene, leading to the diagnosis of x-ALD.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means you have a rare genetic disorder called x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (x-ALD). It affects the nervous system and adrenal glands. Your hematochemical examination disclosed normal cortisol levels with an increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 352 pg/mL, normal value 5–60 pg/mL), consistent with subclinical adrenocortical insufficiency.\nPatient: What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will monitor your condition and provide supportive care to manage your symptoms.

{"id": "68", "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of high fever and scalp swelling with ulcers. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having a high fever and my scalp has been swelling up with these painful ulcers.\nDoctor: I understand. We conducted a physical examination and found that you were conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale/core was 15). We also noticed pus formation, fistula with purulent discharge on your scalp, scalp peeling, face swelling, and poor eating. Our laboratory findings exhibited severe neutropenia with white blood cells at 2.39 × 109/l, neutrophils at 0.25 × 109/l, and lymphocytes at 2.1 × 109/l.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds bad.\nDoctor: Yes, we also found increased acute-phase reactants like erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 101 mm/hour and C-reactive protein at 272 mg/dl. Your pus culture exhibited Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, your blood culture and urine culture were negative.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Your chest X-ray and urinalysis results came back normal, as well as your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. We also checked your serum titers of IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE and percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which were normal.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: We conducted tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, and CMV, and all of them came back negative. We also performed a bone marrow analysis, which revealed a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage with few mature neutrophils. There was no evidence of malignant involvement in the bone marrow.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: We did a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head and skull, which showed subcutaneous emphysema of the scalp, but neither brain injury nor skull fractures were found.\nPatient: Good to know.\nDoctor: Based on all these findings, we diagnosed you with necrotizing fasciitis of the scalp and septicaemia. We treated you with pentaglobin (0.5 g/kg) and a combination of three antibiotics: vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: To maintain your neutrophil count, we administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from 5 to 10 µg/kg/day and 15 µg/kg/day, respectively.\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\nDoctor: After 46 days of treatment, we discharged you from our hospital. Currently, you are well under regular G-CSF therapy.\nPatient: That's great to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, it's essential to continue your G-CSF therapy to manage your severe neutropenia and prevent further infections.

{"id": "70", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello! I understand that your neutered female Briard dog has been experiencing some breathing difficulties lately. Can you tell me more about her symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, she's been having this inspiratory dyspnoea and an audible inspiratory wheeze, especially during exercise and after eating. It's been worsening over the past 3 months. But there's no cough or nasal discharge.\nDoctor: I see. So, she's experiencing increased inspiratory sounds during tracheal and laryngeal auscultation, even at rest, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. And the symptoms get more severe under stress.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. I've had a look at her serum biochemistry, and it shows raised alkaline phosphatase activity at 144 μ/L, while the reference interval is < 95. Other values are within the normal range.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We've also taken radiographs of your dog's cervical and thoracic areas, including right and left lateral and dorsoventral projections. In the left lateral cervical radiograph, we identified a soft tissue opaque, crescent-shaped mass at the level of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae. The mass measures 14 mm × 32 mm, and the tracheal diameter is reduced at that site. However, the mass was not visible in the dorsoventral projection.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Additionally, the cervical and thoracic parts of the esophagus were markedly dilated and air-filled, most likely due to dyspnea.

We'll need to get you admitted to the emergency department immediately to assess your condition. Let's start by getting you intubated to help with your breathing and stabilize your condition.\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\nDoctor: Your blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and your pulse rate is 88/min, so you're haemodynamically stable. We'll need to perform some laboratory tests and a CT scan to further evaluate your injuries.\nPatient: Alright, go ahead.\nDoctor: The computed tomographic scan of your thorax and abdomen showed bilateral pleural effusions with rib fractures, a large haemoperitoneum associated with a traumatic rupture of the spleen with multiple injuries, and a 7-cm mass at the left side of the retroperitoneal space.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We have inserted a thoracic drain on the left side of your thorax, and we will start non-operative management for your spleen.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\nDoctor: During your hospitalization, your haemoglobin decreased from 14.4 to 8.9 g/L after four hours of conservative treatment. This, combined with the appearance of haemodynamic instability, indicates that you require surgery.\nPatient: I see. What will the surgery involve?\nDoctor: We will make an incision on the midline, pack and explore your abdomen. The operation will begin with the clearance of the haemoperitoneum. Your spleen has multiple longitudinal lesions in the visceral aspect, so we will need to remove it carefully to avoid further damage.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: We will proceed with the dissection and ligation of your splenic attachments, ligaments, and vessels to avoid injury or late necrosis of the gastric wall. To avoid pancreatic injuries, we will carry out the dissection in close proximity to the hilum of the spleen, where the splenic artery and veins will be identified, carefully dissected, doubly ligated and fixed with suture ligatures.\nPatient: Okay, I trust you.\nDoctor: After the removal of your spleen, we will obtain and confirm haemostasis through a systematic inspection of the left subphrenic area, the greater curvature of the stomach, the short gastric vessel area, and the splenic area.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

{"id": "73", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 65-year-old man from Morocco with no significant medical history and a non-smoker. Can you tell me what brought you here today?\nPatient: Yes, I've been experiencing left-sided facial pain, frontotemporal headaches, and diplopia for about a month now.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had nasal stuffiness, weight loss, and intermittent epistaxis.\nDoctor: Have you been treated for any of these symptoms before?\nPatient: I was treated in the past for presumed sinusitis, but I didn't get any significant relief from it.\nDoctor: Okay, let's carry out a physical examination. During the examination, I noticed that you have a left eye lateral gaze paralysis. Apart from this, the rest of your physical exam shows no alterations. To further investigate your condition, I recommend a maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan.\n*After the CT scan*\nDoctor: Your CT scan results show complete opacification of the left ethmoid, sphenoid, maxillary, and frontal sinus along with osseous erosion of the cribriform plate. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a brain and orbits magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n*After the MRI*\nDoctor: The MRI revealed a destructive sinonasal malignancy with extension into the bilateral orbits. There are inferior components seen adherent to either side of the nasal septum with intracranial extension. We also conducted an MRI soft tissue of the neck, which showed the mass destroying the hard palate of the maxilla and extending into the bilateral ethmoidal sinuses, maxillary sinuses, anterior walls of the sphenoid sinuses, and medial walls of the bilateral orbits. The mass is also deviating the medial recti medially and extending intracranially into the anterior cranial fossa through the cribriform plate.\nPatient: That sounds bad. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will perform a positron emission tomography (PET) scan for further evaluation.\n*After the PET scan*\nDoctor: The PET scan shows bilateral involvement of ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, with intracranial bifrontal parafalcine extension. However, there are no signs of lymph node involvement. Considering these findings, I suggest you undergo Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery to debulk the nasal mass.\n*After the surgery*\nDoctor: The surgery went well, and we have removed a significant portion of the nasal mass. The pathology report has been amended as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, invasive to the bone, arising within sinonasal papilloma showing inverted and exophytic features. Based on the clinical and histopathological features, the disease has been classified as T4bM0.\nPatient: What does that mean for my prognosis and future treatment?\nDoctor: This classification helps us understand the extent of the disease and plan appropriate treatment options. Your medical team will discuss the best course of action based on your specific case. It's essential to attend all follow-up appointments and report any new or worsening symptoms promptly.", "gold_soap": {"S": "65-year-old male from Morocco, non-smoker, presents with left-sided facial pain, frontotemporal headaches, diplopia for one month, nasal stuffiness, weight loss, and intermittent epistaxis.

I also noticed a worsening cough.\nDoctor: I see. Let's start by taking a detailed look at your medical history. It seems you've been suffering from some comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart disease. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Alright, we found a pulmonary nodule in your lungs, which turned out to be an adenocarcinoma. Due to your comorbidities, we decided not to perform surgery. Have you undergone any treatment for it?\nPatient: Yes, I had stereotaxic radiotherapy, but it didn't seem to help much. The cancer progressed, and I developed lung metastases.\nDoctor: I understand. It seems you've been receiving chemotherapy with vinorelbine and corticosteroids for COPD-related dyspnoea. How has that treatment been working for you?\nPatient: My breathing has improved a bit, but my cough has been getting worse.\nDoctor: To evaluate your worsening cough and dyspnoea, we performed a CT scan of the chest which showed a large amount of gas in the adipose tissue along the caecum, ascending, and transverse colon. We then extended the CT examination to your abdomen, but there were no signs of bowel wall distress or perforation. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or fever recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any pain or fever.\nDoctor: That's good. The surgical consultant suggested close observation alone, as there was no need for immediate intervention. A week later, an abdominal plain film was taken, which documented the persistence of pneumoperitoneum along the right and transverse colon. As your dyspnoea improved, we decided to gradually discontinue steroids and proceed with vinorelbine. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better overall, but my cough is still bothering me.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. A follow-up CT scan performed 4 months later showed improvement in your condition, with the pneumoperitoneum of minimum extent, limited to the caecum. We'll continue monitoring your situation closely and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

{"id": "76", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I'd like to discuss your recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, stage III, in your right mandible. We performed a neck dissection, including mandibular and side resections. How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: I've been feeling okay, I guess. My jaw has been feeling a bit tight though.\nDoctor: That tightness is called trismus, and it should gradually improve after surgery. You shouldn't experience any pain around the TMJ during mandibular function. Have you noticed any issues with your bite, particularly on the left side?\nPatient: Hmm, no, I haven't noticed any problems with my bite while eating.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. During the surgery, we performed a VSP simulation and used CAD/CAM technology to fabricate surgical guides based on the VSP data. We then removed the affected part of your mandible and reconstructed it with a fibula free flap (FFF). The FFF was fixed in place using miniplates, with two plates per connection point.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means we were able to successfully reconstruct your mandible. The fibula was connected to the ascending ramus of your right mandible and the anterior portion was connected to the right mandibular parasymphysis. We then fixed it in place using miniplates. This should provide stability to your reconstructed jaw.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what's next for me, doc?\nDoctor: We'll need to keep a close eye on your progress during postoperative follow-up. We took panoramic radiographs 1 year and 3 months after your surgery, which showed an anterior dislocation of your right condyle. The miniplates at the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus had failed.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the connection between the fibular segment and the anterior mandibular region is not as stable as we'd like it to be. The interocclusal space in the right posterior region hasn't narrowed, but the right mandibular condyle has become dislocated in the anterior direction. This is likely due to a failure to maintain the connection between the fibula and the ascending ramus, leading to severe displacement.\nPatient: So, what can be done about it?\nDoctor: We'll need to address the issue with the miniplates. One of the plates at the bottom gonial angle area has failed, and the superior miniplate is broken. This suggests that a lack of stability may be causing stress-related fatigue fractures in the plates, leading to the displacement of the condylar segment.\nPatient: What will be the next step to fix this issue?\nDoctor: We'll need to schedule another surgery to replace the broken plates and restore stability to the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus. This should help prevent further displacement and complications.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doc.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

{"id": "77", "transcript": "Doctor: Good morning, I see you've presented to the orthopedic hand clinic today. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history and the issue with your right wrist?\nPatient: Good morning, Doctor. I have this small mass on my right wrist that has been extremely sensitive for about three years now. It has subjectively grown over time and the pain has worsened. I also developed hypersensitivity to light contact.\nDoctor: Hmm, that sounds concerning. Is there any cold sensitivity to the mass or any specific area where the pain radiates?\nPatient: No, there's no complaint of cold sensitivity. But the pain occasionally radiates down the ulnar aspect of my wrist.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any trauma to this area before? I noticed from your records that you have a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the hand.\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma to the area. Yes, I was treated for squamous cell carcinoma, but I developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) after that, which delayed my recovery in the range of motion.\nDoctor: Did you undergo any procedures for the RSD, like a stellate ganglion block?\nPatient: I did have a stellate ganglion block, but it didn't provide any relief. I've been doing home exercises to help improve my range of motion slowly.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Let's do a physical exam. I can feel a small round nodule, about 5 mm x 5 mm, with significant point tenderness. The location and exam suggest it could be a neuroma, possibly from a cutaneous nerve or the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. We'll need some imaging to confirm this.\nPatient: Alright, I had plain films taken recently. They didn't show any abnormality except for diffuse osteopenia.\nDoctor: That's helpful information. Given the findings, I recommend surgery to address the mass. During the operation, we'll perform a deep dissection to identify the mass and its connection to any nerves.\nPatient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's go ahead with the surgery.\n[After surgery]\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We found a maroon-colored mass, about 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised, and we confirmed that the ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were not involved with the mass.\nPatient: That's great news. I'm happy to hear the surgery went well.\nDoctor: At your first postoperative visit, please report any pain or discomfort you might be experiencing. We'll also discuss the histopathological review of the excised mass.\n[At the postoperative visit]\nPatient: I have no pain now, and I'm very satisfied with the results of the surgery!\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. The diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin.

I had developed erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking all over my body.\nDoctor: I see. And according to your history, you had consulted a private physician for a toothache and were prescribed methampyrone 500 mg orally, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I took a single dose of the drug and then developed a maculopapular and erythematous rash with itching, followed by bullous exfoliation of the skin.\nDoctor: I also recall that you have a past medical history of hypertension and postprimary coronary intervention in 2011. You have been taking aspirin 80 mg QD, amlodipine 10 mg QD, and atorvastatin 20 mg QD, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When we examined you back then, you were conscious and alert, but looked weak. Your hemodynamics were stable, with a respiration rate of 24x/minutes, body temperature of 37.8°C, and SpO2 of 97–99% while breathing supplementary oxygen with a nasal cannula. There were also signs of conjunctivitis and turbid corneal in your eyes, ulceration of your mouth, and swollen lips.

Nikolsky's sign was clearly elicited, with detachment of the epidermis from lower layers when slightly rubbed, and extension of existing bullae to the clear skin indicated an active TEN. The epidermal detachment was observed over 30% of your body surface area (BSA).\nPatient: Yes, it was quite awful.\nDoctor: Our treatment plan for you involved replacement of fluid loss, maintaining electrolyte imbalance, and providing antibiotic therapy. We started you on methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID. However, after 2 days of hospitalization, your skin lesions did not show much improvement.\nPatient: I remember that.\nDoctor: In turn, your skin change progressions rapidly extended from 32% at hospital admission to 62% of BSA involved, with 16% in grade I and 46% in grade II hemorrhagic blisters. We used the SCORTEN score to prognosticate the risk for death from TEN, and it was three in your case.\nPatient: That was a really difficult time for me and my family.\nDoctor: I understand, and we did our best to help you through it.

Did they perform any tests to investigate your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, they did a chest X-ray which showed left pleural effusion. Then they drained the fluid and sent it to the Pathology Department for analysis.\nDoctor: And what did the analysis show?\nPatient: It revealed malignant cells. So, they did a CT scan of the chest and found a heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass.\nDoctor: I understand. Did they perform any further tests?\nPatient: Yes, they did a chest MRI which showed a well-defined, lobulated, and heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass measuring 15.9 × 15 × 14.5 cm. It's occupying the right hemithorax and causing compressive atelectasis of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.\nDoctor: Were there any signs of direct invasion by the mass?\nPatient: No, they said there were no signs of direct invasion.\nDoctor: Did they investigate any other areas besides the chest?\nPatient: They did a scrotal ultrasound and found bilateral varicocele, but there was no evidence of a testicular mass.\nDoctor: Alright. And did they perform any biopsies?\nPatient: Yes, they did a Tru-Cut biopsy, and the examination showed features of an undifferentiated malignant tumor.\nDoctor: What were the immunohistochemistry results?\nPatient: The tumor cells were strongly positive for AFP, vimentin, and OCT3/4 and focally positive for CD99, CK7, and p63. They were negative for CD30, PLAP, TTF1, HCG, synaptophysin, chromogranin, WT1, and calretinin. The Ki-67 proliferation index was almost 80%.\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it seems that you have a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, also known as a yolk sac tumor. Were you referred to a tertiary healthcare center for further management?\nPatient: Yes, I was. They did another chest MRI and found that the tumor size increased to 21 × 19 × 15 cm.\nDoctor: What treatment did they recommend?\nPatient: They gave me four courses of VIP chemotherapy and then performed a midline sternotomy with resection of the large anterior mediastinal mass.\nDoctor: How are you feeling now, post-surgery?\nPatient: I'm stable symptom-wise, and a chest X-ray revealed no signs of pneumothorax.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

Your visual acuity is 2/10 in the right eye and 5/10 in the left eye.\nPatient: Oh, that's not good.\nDoctor: We also examined your anterior segment and measured your intraocular pressure, both of which were unremarkable. However, the fundus examination revealed atrophy of the retina and choroid.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the layers at the back of your eye are deteriorating, which is likely causing your vision problems. We also performed OCT imaging and found cystoid macular edema (CME), particularly in your right eye.\nPatient: Is that related to the atrophy?\nDoctor: Yes, it can be a contributing factor. We also tested your serum ornithine level, which was 570µmol/L. The reference range is 20-84µmol/L, so your level is quite elevated.\nPatient: What can be done about it?\nDoctor: Your parent has given permission for us to treat your right eye. We'll inject 40 mg/1cc of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) into the posterior sub-Tenon space to address the CME.\nPatient: Will that help improve my vision?\nDoctor: Yes, one month after the treatment, your visual acuity in the right eye increased to 4/10. The intraocular pressure measurements did not show a significant increase, which is good news.\nPatient: How about my left eye?\nDoctor: The fellow eye remained stable during this time period, so there hasn't been any change in your left eye's condition.\nPatient: Is there anything I need to do for follow-up?\nDoctor: We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Can you tell me more about what happened?\nPatient: Yeah, I was just sitting at work when I suddenly felt this moderate epigastric pain. I slumped down in my chair and lost consciousness. The people around me caught me when I was falling from my chair.\nDoctor: I see. Have you ever experienced syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting before this incident?\nPatient: No, I've never had an episode like this before.\nDoctor: Alright. Are you a smoker, and do you consume alcohol?\nPatient: I'm a nonsmoker, but I do have occasional alcohol intake.\nDoctor: When you arrived at the emergency department, your blood pressure was 125/58 mmHg, heart rate 55 beats per minute, and you were afebrile. You also saturated 100% on room air. We performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed sinus bradycardia at 53 beats per minute, peaked T waves, 1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and 2 mm ST elevation in V3. \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Due to the concern for ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), we gave you aspirin 324 mg and took you for left heart catheterization (LHC) emergently. The LHC showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).\nPatient: Hmm, alright.\nDoctor: Your laboratory workup was remarkable for lipase of 25,304 IU/l (normal level 8–78 IU/l) and white blood count 11,800/mcl. Your liver function test, serum electrolyte level, and triglyceride level were unremarkable. Troponin was <0.01 ng/ml.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We also performed a computed tomographic exam of your abdomen, which revealed acute interstitial pancreatitis with a small discrete fluid collection in the uncinate process. We conducted an ultrasound of your abdomen as well, which ruled out biliary etiology. It showed a normal appearance of the gallbladder and biliary tree, without evidence of calculus or obstruction.\nPatient: Okay, that's good to know.\nDoctor: Your echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormality. We admitted you to the telemetry floor and treated you with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation.\nPatient: I did feel better the following day.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

{"id": "86", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been having some vague epigastric discomfort lately.\nDoctor: I see. We'll need to run some tests to find out what's going on. We'll start with a chest computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\n(After obtaining the CT results)\nDoctor: The CT scan identified a calcified cyst in the tail of your pancreas. Your laboratory tests showed a serum amylase level of 402 U/L and a lipase level of 553 U/L. We'll need to perform additional imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before a surgical consultation to further characterize the pancreatic lesion.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do those tests.\n(After undergoing the additional imaging)\nDoctor: Your imaging results are in. At the time of your visit, you were asymptomatic, without abdominal pain, back pain, steatorrhea, jaundice, weight loss, or nausea. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Pertinent laboratory data included a serum CA 19-9 level of 35 U/mL, HbA1c level of 6.1%, repeat amylase level of 378 U/L, and repeat lipase level of 439 U/L.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Your abdominal imaging revealed a 3 cm complex cystic mass in the pancreatic tail, with thickened septa, and an associated solid nodule that appeared calcified, and was associated with central scarring. These findings were suggestive of a benign serous cystadenoma. However, peripheral enhancement was observed on an MRI, raising the possibility of a mucinous cystic neoplasm as well.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: The peripancreatic edema on CT was interpreted as evidence of acute pancreatitis, further confounding the clinical picture. Endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration of the cyst were not performed because of anatomic inaccessibility related to the cyst's location near the splenic hilum, and away from the posterior wall of the stomach.\nPatient: What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We're going to offer you resectional therapy based on the fact that your symptoms and serum tests reflected pancreatitis, which is attributable to the pancreatic cyst. The possibility of a mucinous neoplasm and a serum CA 19-9 level at the upper range of normal also factored into the decision.\nPatient: Alright, what does that involve?\nDoctor: You will undergo a laparoscopic distal procedure to remove the affected part of the pancreas. We'll closely monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care.\nPatient: Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate it.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

We need to admit you to our hospital for radical surgical treatment. \nPatient: Oh no, that's concerning. What did the tests show?\nDoctor: Your physical examinations and blood tests revealed nothing of note, including tumor markers. We performed an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) and found that the type 0-IIc gastric cancer is located in the posterior wall of the mid-body of your stomach (Fig. a). The histological type is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. So what's the plan for treatment?\nDoctor: Based on your preoperative examinations, we planned to perform a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and Billroth-I reconstruction. The tumor invasion is at the submucosal layer without lymph node swelling. Your clinical stage according to the TNM 7th edition is cT1b N0 M0, cStage I.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: The surgery progressed without any problems on dissection around the left gastroepiploic vessels. However, during the dissection of the infrapyloric area (Fig. a), a part of the pancreatic head showed unusual adherence to the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. b). This made it difficult to safely separate the pancreatic head from the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. c).\nPatient: Oh, so what did you do next?\nDoctor: Since we needed to dissect and mobilize the duodenal bulb as much as possible for Billroth-I anastomosis (delta-shaped anastomosis using linear staplers), we decided to change our reconstruction plan of the Billroth-I method to Roux-en-Y. To avoid causing pancreatic injury during the lymphadenectomy, we focused on tracing the dissectible layer between the pancreatic parenchyma and fatty tissues, including lymph nodes (Fig. d).\nPatient: I see. Was there anything else unusual during the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, after the distal gastrectomy, we couldn't find the ligament of Treitz or jejunum on the left side, below the transverse colon. Furthermore, the right-side colon had been completely mobilized to the left-side abdomen (Fig. a).\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. What are the next steps for my treatment and recovery?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor your recovery and provide appropriate postoperative care.

How long has this been going on?\nPatient 1: It's been recurrent, but I've noticed that it usually happens when I'm fasting during Ramadan or when I travel to North America.\nDoctor: Interesting. Can you describe the appearance of the eruption after it resolves?\nPatient 1: Yes, after the itching goes away, it leaves behind a net-like pigmentation.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Based on your description, it seems like the eruptions are linked to fasting and your travels. Have you experienced any other medical problems recently?\nPatient 1: No, I haven't had any other medical issues.\nDoctor: That's good to know. It's important to identify any potential underlying conditions that could be contributing to these eruptions. Since you haven't had any other medical problems, we can focus on managing the symptoms and trying to prevent future occurrences.\nPatient 1: Okay, what should I do to manage the symptoms and prevent them from happening again?\nDoctor: First, I recommend keeping your skin moisturized and avoiding irritants that could exacerbate the itching. Also, try to minimize stress, as it can trigger flare-ups. You may want to consider adjusting your fasting practices during Ramadan or adjusting your travel plans to reduce the likelihood of eruptions.\nPatient 1: Alright, I'll try to follow your suggestions.

{"id": "95", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'll be conducting your evaluation today. Can you please tell me the main concerns you have with your child?\nParent: Hi, Doctor. Our five-month-old son has had global developmental delay since birth, and he's been experiencing remittent fever, recurrent seizures, and vomiting for the past three months.\nDoctor: I see. Let's talk about the pregnancy first. Was it planned or unplanned?\nParent: The pregnancy was unplanned.\nDoctor: Okay. I understand that your child had a low birth weight of 2.2 kg and symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Has he had any issues with weight gain since then?\nParent: Yes, he's had recurrent vomiting since he was two months old, and his weight gain has been poor.\nDoctor: That must be concerning for you. Has he experienced any regression in his development, such as loss of visual fixation or social smile?\nParent: Yes, he lost his social smile, and his visual fixation has become poor as well.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has he had any fevers, and if so, were there any negative septic screens conducted?\nParent: He's had remittent fevers for several months, but all the septic screens came back negative.\nDoctor: Alright. Given the negative screens, it's possible that there may be a central cause related to irregularities in thermoregulation. Has he developed any unusual movements, such as dystonia or dyskinetic movements?\nParent: Yes, he has developed marked dystonia and dyskinetic movements lately.\nDoctor: It seems like there might be involvement of the extrapyramidal nervous system. Has your elder child experienced similar issues, such as epileptic encephalopathy?\nParent: Yes, our elder child had developmental regression and epileptic encephalopathy. He passed away at 1 ½ years of age due to aspiration pneumonia while being evaluated for a neuro-metabolic disorder.\nDoctor: I'm very sorry to hear that. During the clinical examination of your younger child, we found severe growth retardation and spasticity in all four limbs, with exaggerated reflexes. The Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed encephalopathy.\nParent: That sounds really concerning, Doctor.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. The Brain MRI showed multiple areas of increased T2 signal intensity with diffusion restriction involving the brain stem, basal ganglia, and white matter tracts, suggesting widespread demyelination. The urine FeCl3 test came back positive for phenylketonuria.\nParent: What does that mean for our child?\nDoctor: Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that could explain some of your child's symptoms. Our tests also showed an elevated Phenylalanine level of 1245.71 μM, with a normal range being 25-120 μM, and a Phenylalanine/Tyrosine ratio of 21.87, where the normal range is 0.4-2.2. Additionally, his blood Neopterin levels were very low at 0.01 nmol/g Hb.\nParent: What do these results mean for our son's condition and treatment?\nDoctor: The results indicate a possible metabolic disorder, which could be contributing to your child's symptoms. We'll need to discuss further tests and potential treatment options to manage his condition. It's important to closely monitor his progress and follow up with regular appointments.\nParent: Thank you, Doctor.

Can you tell me more about your smoking habits?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been smoking marijuana and tobacco for quite some time now. I don't really drink alcohol or use any other drugs, though.\nDoctor: I understand. Unfortunately, you recently suffered an acute thalamomesencephalic stroke which has rapidly worsened, leading you to a comatose state. Your personal medical history and familial history show no association with cardiocerebrovascular pathology or other specific risk factors. \nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible...\nDoctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. On the evening before this cerebral infarction, you had a large tattoo done on your left hypochondrium and abdominal flank, and you smoked a few cigarettes with cannabis. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I got the tattoo and smoked some joints afterward.\nDoctor: The next morning, you experienced acute onset of dizziness, visual, speech, and gait disturbances. Can you describe those symptoms?\nPatient: I was feeling really dizzy, had trouble seeing, speaking, and walking properly.\nDoctor: You were then admitted to the emergency room with walking difficulties, disturbed balance and coordination of movements, slurred speech, diplopia, confusion, and left palpebral ptosis. Our neurological examination revealed right-sided severe ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis and mydriasis, divergent strabismus, and fluctuating consciousness, with a Glasgow coma scale of 10/15.\nPatient: That sounds really bad...\nDoctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We also conducted blood tests, including white blood cells count, hemoglobin, electrolytes, liver, and renal function, all of which revealed normal results. However, your urine toxicology at admission was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. No other illicit drugs were present on the tox screen.

Can you tell me what happened?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm a chef at an Indian restaurant, and I accidentally chopped my middle, ring, and little fingers on my left hand. The fingers couldn't be replanted, so they had to be amputated.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. So you had amputations of the middle and ring fingers at the level of the proximal phalanx and of the little finger at the middle phalanx. And now, six months after the injury, you've been referred to our hospital for hand reconstruction, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I have reviewed your radiographic images which confirmed the clinical findings. Your preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 4/10, indicating some phantom pain after the amputations, and your Quick-DASH was 81.82/100.00. Have you experienced any changes in pain or function since then?\nPatient: No, it's been pretty consistent.\nDoctor: We performed an examination of your foot vascularity with contrast-enhanced computed tomography and found that bilateral STT was compatible for the reconstruction of two fingers. Therefore, we can proceed with transferring your bilateral second toes to the middle and ring fingers.\nPatient: Okay, what does that involve?\nDoctor: First, we'll make a curved incision over the volar surface of the distal middle and ring fingers. We'll then identify and isolate the digital artery, digital nerve, and flexor digitorum profundus on the volar side to provide for inflow and reinnervation.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: Next, we'll mark the dorsalis pedis artery and superficial dorsal vein under ultrasound guidance, then create a v-shaped incision at the base of the second toe and extend it proximally. We'll perform dissections on both the dorsal and plantar sides to identify key structures like the extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, and proper palmer digital nerves.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We'll then disarticulate the second metatarsophalangeal joint and harvest the second toe with a long pedicle to facilitate vascular anastomosis and avoid kinking of the artery. Finally, we'll transfer the second toe to your middle and ring fingers, reconnecting the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons.\nPatient: I understand. What will the recovery process be like?\nDoctor: Recovery will involve some physical therapy to regain function and manage any pain. It may take several months, but we'll monitor your progress closely and make adjustments as needed.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

According to the Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition, it's classified as T1bN3M0, with the primary tumor in your left lower lobe and multiple lymph node metastases in 2R, 4R, 7, and 10L. Can you tell me if you have any past medical history or complications?\nPatient: No, I don't have any past medical issues or complications.\nDoctor: That's good. I see that both your epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase status are negative, and your PD-L1 expression is 0%. Have you already received any treatment for your lung adenocarcinoma?\nPatient: Yes, I've received chemotherapy as the initial treatment because CRT wasn't suitable due to the wide extent and size of the tumor. I was given four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab.\nDoctor: I understand. And after that, you were treated with pemetrexed and bevacizumab as maintenance therapy, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It looks like your tumor decreased in size once, but then it regrew. However, the tumor size is now smaller than before the initial treatment, which makes CRT possible at this timing. We've decided to perform CRT followed by durvalumab as the next treatment for you on the cancer board.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: CRT was performed one month after your last administration of pemetrexed and bevacizumab. For the large tumor lesions, we prescribed up to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with involved-field radiotherapy to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. The dose was given through parallel-opposed anteroposterior portals up to 30 Gy, and multiportal beams were used to reduce the dose in the spinal cord from 30 to 50 Gy. Weekly carboplatin (area under the curve, 2.0) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) were administered concomitantly.\nPatient: Were there any major adverse events during CRT?\nDoctor: No, there were no major adverse events observed during CRT. One month after CRT, your tumor decreased in size, and there were no new lesions or adverse effects, such as esophagitis and pneumonitis.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, it's positive progress. As a result, we started durvalumab (10 mg/m2, every 2 weeks) after confirming the absence of new lesions and adverse effects.\nPatient: How long will I be on durvalumab?\nDoctor: You'll receive three courses of durvalumab, which will be 2.5 months after the completion of CRT.

{"id": "99", "transcript": "Doctor: Good morning, sir. I see here that you have no apparent past medical history. What brings you in today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I've been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting lately.\nDoctor: I see. We'll need to do a physical examination and run some tests to determine the cause. I'll start with the physical examination. *After examination* Everything seems to be normal with the physical examination. Now, let's review your lab results.\nDoctor: Your lab results show that you have anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit at 32.2%, and lipase at 164 U/L. Your comprehensive metabolic panel is unrevealing, so we performed a CT of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a better look.\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed an enlarged pancreas without a focal mass, diffuse surrounding mesenteric edema, mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy, rectal wall thickening with perirectal lymphadenopathy, left renal mass measuring 3.7 × 1.4 × 1.4 cm, right renal mass measuring 2.3 × 4.3 × 5.2 cm, marked diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion. This raised concern for peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or mesenteric tumor.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We wanted to be thorough, so we invited urology and oncology services to evaluate you. They both agreed that a biopsy of the lymph node was necessary, along with urine cytology and HIV testing.\nDoctor: Your urine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes. The renal biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A bone marrow biopsy was also performed and was consistent with involvement of B-cell lymphoma.\nPatient: That's scary. What about the HIV test?\nDoctor: Your HTLV-I/II antibody test came back negative, but your HIV screening was positive. Your initial CD4 count was 440/μl with a percentage of 14%, and your HIV RNA viral load by PCR was 61,800 copies/mL.\nPatient: Oh no. What about hepatitis?\nDoctor: Your hepatitis C virus screening was negative. Your hepatitis B screening showed that you were positive for the core antibody and surface antibody, but negative for the surface antigen.\nDoctor: Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also above the upper limit of detection for our lab, at >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Finally, the biopsy of your kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for other markers.\nPatient: So, what's the plan, doctor? What do we do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to consult with specialists in oncology and infectious diseases to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will guide us on how to manage both your lymphoma and HIV. We'll also closely monitor your hepatitis B status. Rest assured, we will work together to provide you with the best care possible.", "gold_soap": {"S": "The patient, a male with no significant past medical history, presents with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
