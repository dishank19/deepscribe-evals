{"id": "47", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you're an 85-year-old woman with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) and have been admitted to undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, I had a history of cerebral infarction, but no remarkable family history.\nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any recent symptoms?\nPatient: I've been having chest pain, clammy sweat, and anorexia lately. I visited a local doctor for AS treatment.\nDoctor: I understand. After the preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), did you experience any new symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I developed chest and back pain and even had a fever.\nDoctor: It seems that the symptoms did not improve, and the computed tomography (CT) revealed prominent mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusion. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed esophageal perforation located 30 cm from the incisors, and gastrografin contrast revealed mediastinum leakage.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the diagnosis?\nDoctor: You've been diagnosed with thoracic esophageal perforation. Because of your age and severe AS, radical thoracotomy surgery for primary repair or resection would be difficult. Instead, we will perform a two-stage surgery and indirect approach, which includes cervical esophagostomy to avoid contamination, gastrostomy for decompression, and jejunostomy for nutrition. Reconstruction will be planned after the mediastinitis and perforation are healed.\nPatient: Alright, what's next?\nDoctor: We performed an emergency operation 32 hours after the TEE under general anesthesia. A 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed through the umbilicus, and four 5-mm ports were placed in the left upper, right upper, left middle, and right middle quadrants. We washed the contaminated mediastinum with saline through the esophageal hiatus from the abdominal cavity side and placed a drainage tube in the mediastinum. Then, we performed gastrostomy and jejunostomy laparoscopically, followed by cervical esophagostomy using a tube. Esophageal dissection was performed by an autosuture device.\nPatient: How did the operation go?\nDoctor: The operation was successful, with an operation time of 2 hours and 14 minutes and minimal blood loss.\nPatient: That's good to hear. How's my recovery?\nDoctor: Your postoperative clinical course has been good. At 11 days postoperatively, a CT revealed almost complete resolution of the mediastinal air and cavity, and the mediastinal drain was removed.\nPatient: What's the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: At 22 days postoperatively, we performed an endoscopic retrograde observation via gastrostomy and found that the perforation had healed. We will continue to monitor your progress and plan for reconstruction when the mediastinitis and perforation are fully healed.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the care and attention to my condition.", "gold_soap": {"S": "The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic valve stenosis and cerebral infarction, presenting with recent symptoms of chest pain, clammy sweat, anorexia, and post-procedural chest and back pain with fever.
