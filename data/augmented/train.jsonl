You had a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D; Medtronic® Viva XT CRT-D; AAI 60) implanted 7 years ago. This was to help with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Later, as a bridge to transplantation, you had a HeartMate II® LVAD implanted 4 years ago. No arrhythmia developed immediately after LVAD implantation, so your CRT-D shock therapy was turned off.

However, your right ventricular (RV) contraction had maintained well relatively (RV fractional area change; 33%). \nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: Eight months after LVAD implantation, you developed palpitations and were admitted to our hospital due to repeated VAs necessitating electrical defibrillation.

I also have a history of asthma, but no history of blood cell transfusion or medication, except for the antibiotic cephem during ICSI to prevent infection.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. At your first visit, we administered a blood test which revealed that you are D-antigen-positive and irregular antibody-negative. Your hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dl. Now, at 28 weeks of gestation, a recent blood test showed acute macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 108.1 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 35.3 pg. We performed a detailed examination to determine the reason for these results.\nPatient: Oh wow, that sounds concerning.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is reported as a disease that causes anemia, but it was also unlikely because a test for anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Your C3, C4, and erythrocyte-binding IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were also normal. We then suspected the presence of hemolytic anemia and performed several additional examinations.\nPatient: So, what were the results of those additional examinations?\nDoctor: We found an increase of reticulocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a marked decrease of haptoglobin (<10 mg/dl). Upon further examination of the LDH fractions, we observed that LDH1 and LDH2 were markedly increased. Your urine was negative for hemoglobin. These results strongly suggest the presence of hemolysis.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me and my baby?\nDoctor: It means that your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than it can produce them, causing anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for anti-IgG and negative for anti-C3d, while the indirect antiglobulin test was negative.

So, we took your boy to the operation room (OR) immediately for a diagnostic laparoscopy.\nParent: What did you find during the operation?\nDoctor: We detected a left-sided Bochdalek hernia with herniation of the small intestine, spleen, and stomach into the chest. Bile-stained fluid was found in the thorax and abdomen. We repositioned the herniated organs back into the abdomen and discovered a gastric perforation at the lesser curvature, which explained the pneumothorax he was experiencing.\nParent: Oh no, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We decided that the gastric perforation couldn't be closed safely laparoscopically, so we performed a conversion to laparotomy. We closed the gastric perforation and repaired the diaphragmatic hernia with interrupted stitches.\nParent: How did he recover after the surgery?\nDoctor: After extubation on the fourth postoperative day, a retrovesical abscess was detected and drained 30 days after the surgery. Due to gastroparesis, your boy showed a prolonged recovery and was finally discharged after 4 to 5 weeks in good condition.\nParent: I'm glad he recovered well. How is he doing now?\nDoctor: After a follow-up of 2 years, your boy is asymptomatic and doing well.

I've been experiencing some left lower quadrant abdominal pain lately.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your family history a bit. I see that your brother had lung cancer at the age of 62 years and had a risk factor of chronic smoking. Your paternal grandmother had bilateral synchronous breast cancer at 80, and your grandfather had prostate cancer at 79. Is there any family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer?\nPatient: No, there's no family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer that I'm aware of.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. We'll need to perform a physical examination and a CT scan of your abdomen to identify any issues. \n(After the examination and CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan of your abdomen showed an obstructed rectosigmoid mass. We then performed a colonoscopy which revealed a recto sigmoid mass measuring 4.5 × 6.5 cm, located 18 cm from the anal verge. The biopsy results indicate a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about the CT scan of the chest? Did it show any distant metastases?\nDoctor: Fortunately, the CT scan of the chest and abdomen did not show any evidence of distant metastases. We went ahead with a laparoscopic rectosigmoid and local lymph node resection with a left end colostomy. The pathology showed an invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration beyond the muscularis propria into subserosal tissue.\nDoctor: There were high-risk features, including lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Six of the twenty-eight lymph nodes we analyzed were positive for adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: So what does all this mean for me? \nDoctor: After your colectomy, we sent the initial surgical specimen for analysis with next-generation sequencing. The tumor mutations included BRIP1 P619Fs*20, TP53 S2151, splice site 783-2A > G, CDK8 amplification was equivocal, and APC E 1295*. Your Lynch syndrome screen by immunohistochemistry (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins) showed normal expression in pathological tissue. There were no reportable alterations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF.\nPatient: I had colon cancer at such a young age with no family history. Can we do an evaluation of a possible hereditary predisposition?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed an initial testing with a commercially available 17-gene colon cancer risk panel, and the results were negative. However, we proposed additional germline testing for the BRIP1 gene mutation based on the high allele frequency of the BRIP1 mutation found in your tumor.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. It is important for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep an eye on any new symptoms that may arise.

{"id": "32", "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand your 8-month-old female infant had a coronary reimplantation at age 3 months for ALCAPA. How has she been since the surgery?\nPatient's parent: She seemed to be doing better at first, but lately, she's been having some issues.\nDoctor: I see. What kind of issues has she been experiencing?\nPatient's parent: She's been having trouble breathing, and she hasn't been growing as expected.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Her postsurgical ejection fraction did show early improvement, but it seems there has been some subsequent deterioration. We performed a diagnostic left heart catheterization as part of a heart transplant evaluation and discovered severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. This could be the reason for her symptoms.\nPatient's parent: Oh no, that sounds serious. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We've decided to refer her for PCI of the left main coronary artery to relieve her heart failure and preempt the need for a heart transplant. Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function.\nPatient's parent: Okay, so what does the procedure involve?\nDoctor: A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram were performed, which demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. The procedure was carried out in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology teams.\nPatient's parent: That sounds like a lot of experts involved. How was the procedure done?\nDoctor: We used general anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant's aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion.\nPatient's parent: And what happened next?\nDoctor: Since the infant's left main coronary artery was small but expected to grow with age, we implanted a somewhat larger (3.0 × 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. However, a post-stent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation, missing the ostium and leaving residual stenosis of the LMCA origin.\nPatient's parent: Oh dear, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We then placed a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent into the LMCA ostium, overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters into the aorta proximally. This should help improve the blood flow in her heart.\nPatient's parent: I hope that helps her.

We took a color fundus photograph of your left eye, which revealed subtle deep retinal white spots in the posterior pole and around the optic disk.\nDoctor: Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated wreath-like punctate areas of early hyperfluorescence that corresponded to the deep white retinal lesions. Optic disc staining was observed in the late phase of FA. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed several hyperautofluorescent lesions topographically corresponding to the white lesions seen on the color fundus photograph.\nDoctor: We also performed a cross-sectional optical coherence tomography (OCT) which showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the same topography of the spots seen on both FAF and FA. Punctate hypereflective lesions and hyporeflective dots were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and choroid, respectively.\nDoctor: En-face OCT at the level of outer retina demonstrated multiple hyporeflective spots corresponding to the disruption of the EZ seen on the cross-sectional OCT. There was an absence of flow impairment in both the retinal and choroidal vasculature on OCT angiography (OCTA).\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it seems that your visual symptoms are caused by an underlying issue with your retina. We'll need to monitor your condition closely and discuss possible treatment options.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me.

Your laboratory findings showed a blood glucose level of 470 mg/dL and an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.2, PCO2 of 25.2 mmHg, HCO3 of 9.9 mEq/L, and PO2 of 169 mmHg with an anion gap of 24.3 mEq/L. We also found positive urinary ketones and glucose.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: These findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. To further investigate, we performed an intubation and an emergency endoscopy. We observed black pigmentation in your entire esophageal mucosa.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also did a CT scan, which revealed circumferential edematous thickening of your esophageal wall with slight pleural effusion. However, there was no obvious sign of perforation or free air in the mediastinum. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with acute esophageal necrosis (AEN).\nPatient: What's the treatment plan, doctor?\nDoctor: We started you on antibiotics, glycemic control, a proton pump inhibitor, and plasmapheresis. You gradually stabilized and were extubated on day 5. However, you still had a fever, and the chest X-ray showed the accumulation of pleural effusion.\nPatient: What happened next?\nDoctor: On day 7, we suspected esophageal perforation due to the significant increase of the right pleural effusion and free air in the mediastinum on a CT scan. We performed an emergency thoracoscopy in a left semiprone position with differential lung ventilation and artificial pneumothorax.\nPatient: That sounds intense.\nDoctor: Yes, it was a necessary procedure. We observed significant pleural effusion with pus and perforation of the esophagus. We resected the transmural necrotic thoracic esophagus and placed drainage tubes at the anterior side of the thoracic cavity, at the posterior mediastinum, and above the diaphragm.\nPatient: What's the next step in my recovery?\nDoctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and ensure that you receive the appropriate care and treatment moving forward.

You presented with bilateral symptomatic large renal stones, and underwent staged stone treatment. Prior to coming to our hospital, you had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion, left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and FURS and laser stone fragmentation for the left renal stones. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. But I didn't get much relief, so I came here for further advice.\nDoctor: I see. We conducted a non-contrast CT scan, which showed multiple bilateral renal stones.

How are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hi doctor, I'm feeling okay, but I've been experiencing some issues lately.\nDoctor: What kind of issues? Any specific symptoms?\nPatient: Well, back in 2013 I had some self-limiting epistaxis and easy bruising.\nDoctor: I see. We had performed some laboratory tests when you presented those symptoms. Your abnormal coagulation profile showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12.4 seconds, INR of 1.2, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 38 seconds. Your elevated alkaline phosphatase was at 160 U/L and creatinine at 1.16 mg/dL. You also had proteinuria with 882 mg/24 h. Do you remember the results of your abdominal ultrasound?\nPatient: Yes, it demonstrated hepatomegaly with the right lobe measuring 21 cm in the craniocaudal dimension.\nDoctor: Correct. And your serum and urine electrophoreses were remarkable for the presence of a paraprotein, immunoglobulin G-lambda. The abdominal fat pad biopsy was unrevealing, but your liver biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemical staining of the liver tissue revealed the presence of lambda light chain. Do you remember the results of your bone marrow core biopsy?\nPatient: I do. It had extensive amyloid deposition, was positive for Congo red staining with classical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, and the Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was positive for lambda light chains.\nDoctor: That's right. So, further work-up of the abnormal coagulation study revealed a decreased FX coagulation activity of 45% (reference 70%-150%). Screening for an inhibitor to FX was negative. This led us to diagnose you with acquired FX deficiency secondary to AL amyloidosis. Due to your recurrent lung adenocarcinoma, you were deemed a poor candidate for autologous stem cell transplantation, so we started you on melphalan and dexamethasone chemotherapy. How has that been going for you?\nPatient: It's been going okay, but in 2015 I developed an episode of symptomatic PAF.\nDoctor: I see.

However, no macroscopic mass was evident at that time. Three months later, another MRI showed a mass of 3 cm diameter in the right frontal lobe.\nPatient's Parent: Oh, that's concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We decided to move forward with surgery to remove the tumor. Although the tumor was completely resected, I'm sorry to inform you that your child passed away 4 months after the surgery.\nPatient's Parent: It's heartbreaking, but we understand.\nDoctor: The pathological evaluation of the CNS lesion revealed that the mass was grossly dark-red to brown and measured (4 × 4 × 2) cm. It was firmly attached to the meninges. Microscopically, the tumor cells had atypical nuclei, obvious nucleoli, an increased karyoplasmic ratio, some mitoses, and remarkable necrosis. They infiltrated the brain parenchyma and were accompanied by melanin deposition.\nPatient's Parent: What were the results of the immunohistopathological evaluation?\nDoctor: The tumor cells positively expressed the antibodies of HMB45, Melan-A, and S100. However, the Ki-67 was positively expressed in 30% of the cells, while P53 was negative.\nPatient's Parent: And what about the cytogenetic study?\nDoctor: The cytogenetic study using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a lack of allelic deletion of P53.

{"id": "76", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I'd like to discuss your recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, stage III, in your right mandible. We performed a neck dissection, including mandibular and side resections. How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: I've been feeling okay, I guess. My jaw has been feeling a bit tight though.\nDoctor: That tightness is called trismus, and it should gradually improve after surgery. You shouldn't experience any pain around the TMJ during mandibular function. Have you noticed any issues with your bite, particularly on the left side?\nPatient: Hmm, no, I haven't noticed any problems with my bite while eating.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. During the surgery, we performed a VSP simulation and used CAD/CAM technology to fabricate surgical guides based on the VSP data. We then removed the affected part of your mandible and reconstructed it with a fibula free flap (FFF). The FFF was fixed in place using miniplates, with two plates per connection point.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means we were able to successfully reconstruct your mandible. The fibula was connected to the ascending ramus of your right mandible and the anterior portion was connected to the right mandibular parasymphysis. We then fixed it in place using miniplates. This should provide stability to your reconstructed jaw.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what's next for me, doc?\nDoctor: We'll need to keep a close eye on your progress during postoperative follow-up. We took panoramic radiographs 1 year and 3 months after your surgery, which showed an anterior dislocation of your right condyle. The miniplates at the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus had failed.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the connection between the fibular segment and the anterior mandibular region is not as stable as we'd like it to be. The interocclusal space in the right posterior region hasn't narrowed, but the right mandibular condyle has become dislocated in the anterior direction. This is likely due to a failure to maintain the connection between the fibula and the ascending ramus, leading to severe displacement.\nPatient: So, what can be done about it?\nDoctor: We'll need to address the issue with the miniplates. One of the plates at the bottom gonial angle area has failed, and the superior miniplate is broken. This suggests that a lack of stability may be causing stress-related fatigue fractures in the plates, leading to the displacement of the condylar segment.\nPatient: What will be the next step to fix this issue?\nDoctor: We'll need to schedule another surgery to replace the broken plates and restore stability to the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus. This should help prevent further displacement and complications.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doc.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

When we examined you, you were alert and able to obey commands. We did notice neck stiffness during the physical examination. We ran some laboratory tests and your blood glucose, electrolytes, blood cell counts, coagulation test, and antinuclear antibody series were all within normal limits.\nPatient: That's good to hear, but what did you find in the tests?\nDoctor: We performed a head computed tomography (CT) and found a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) concentrated in the perimesencephalic cistern (Fig. a). We also did a CT angiography (CTA) which showed that the bilateral ICAs were absent in the skull base (Fig. b-c). The bilateral MCAs and anterior arteries were normal, but we identified an aneurysm in the PCA region (Fig. d).\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does it mean?\nDoctor: We also conducted a head digital subtraction angiography (DSA) that showed the bilateral internal maxillary arteries and ascending pharyngeal arteries were confluent with the cavernous portion of the ICAs at the skull base. The bilateral ICAs above the cavernous portion of the ICAs, the MCAs, and the anterior cerebral arteries were normal (Fig. ). The right vertebral artery (VA) was fine, while the left VA was well developed (Fig. a-b). We observed moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels in the bilateral PCAs region, the distal part of the PCA was composed of abnormally fine vessels, and an aneurysm was clearly identified in the left moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels (Fig. c-d).\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor?\nDoctor: You have been diagnosed with bilateral carotid RM, moyamoya-like vessels in the PCA region, intracranial pseudoaneurysm, and SAH. \nPatient: What's the plan for managing this?\nDoctor: Management of the aneurysm is difficult, so we have decided to adopt a wait and see management approach. You have been recovering well and we plan to discharge you one week after your admission.\nPatient: I see, and what about follow-up?\nDoctor: We will schedule a follow-up CT for you 44 days after your discharge.

{"id": "97", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I understand that you had an injury to your left hand about a year ago, involving a meat chopper. Can you tell me what happened?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm a chef at an Indian restaurant, and I accidentally chopped my middle, ring, and little fingers on my left hand. The fingers couldn't be replanted, so they had to be amputated.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. So you had amputations of the middle and ring fingers at the level of the proximal phalanx and of the little finger at the middle phalanx. And now, six months after the injury, you've been referred to our hospital for hand reconstruction, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I have reviewed your radiographic images which confirmed the clinical findings. Your preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 4/10, indicating some phantom pain after the amputations, and your Quick-DASH was 81.82/100.00. Have you experienced any changes in pain or function since then?\nPatient: No, it's been pretty consistent.\nDoctor: We performed an examination of your foot vascularity with contrast-enhanced computed tomography and found that bilateral STT was compatible for the reconstruction of two fingers. Therefore, we can proceed with transferring your bilateral second toes to the middle and ring fingers.\nPatient: Okay, what does that involve?\nDoctor: First, we'll make a curved incision over the volar surface of the distal middle and ring fingers. We'll then identify and isolate the digital artery, digital nerve, and flexor digitorum profundus on the volar side to provide for inflow and reinnervation.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: Next, we'll mark the dorsalis pedis artery and superficial dorsal vein under ultrasound guidance, then create a v-shaped incision at the base of the second toe and extend it proximally. We'll perform dissections on both the dorsal and plantar sides to identify key structures like the extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, and proper palmer digital nerves.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We'll then disarticulate the second metatarsophalangeal joint and harvest the second toe with a long pedicle to facilitate vascular anastomosis and avoid kinking of the artery. Finally, we'll transfer the second toe to your middle and ring fingers, reconnecting the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons.\nPatient: I understand. What will the recovery process be like?\nDoctor: Recovery will involve some physical therapy to regain function and manage any pain. It may take several months, but we'll monitor your progress closely and make adjustments as needed.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

{"id": "98", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. According to the Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition, it's classified as T1bN3M0, with the primary tumor in your left lower lobe and multiple lymph node metastases in 2R, 4R, 7, and 10L. Can you tell me if you have any past medical history or complications?\nPatient: No, I don't have any past medical issues or complications.\nDoctor: That's good. I see that both your epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase status are negative, and your PD-L1 expression is 0%. Have you already received any treatment for your lung adenocarcinoma?\nPatient: Yes, I've received chemotherapy as the initial treatment because CRT wasn't suitable due to the wide extent and size of the tumor. I was given four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab.\nDoctor: I understand. And after that, you were treated with pemetrexed and bevacizumab as maintenance therapy, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It looks like your tumor decreased in size once, but then it regrew. However, the tumor size is now smaller than before the initial treatment, which makes CRT possible at this timing. We've decided to perform CRT followed by durvalumab as the next treatment for you on the cancer board.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: CRT was performed one month after your last administration of pemetrexed and bevacizumab. For the large tumor lesions, we prescribed up to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with involved-field radiotherapy to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. The dose was given through parallel-opposed anteroposterior portals up to 30 Gy, and multiportal beams were used to reduce the dose in the spinal cord from 30 to 50 Gy. Weekly carboplatin (area under the curve, 2.0) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) were administered concomitantly.\nPatient: Were there any major adverse events during CRT?\nDoctor: No, there were no major adverse events observed during CRT. One month after CRT, your tumor decreased in size, and there were no new lesions or adverse effects, such as esophagitis and pneumonitis.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, it's positive progress. As a result, we started durvalumab (10 mg/m2, every 2 weeks) after confirming the absence of new lesions and adverse effects.\nPatient: How long will I be on durvalumab?\nDoctor: You'll receive three courses of durvalumab, which will be 2.5 months after the completion of CRT.

I've been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting lately.\nDoctor: I see. We'll need to do a physical examination and run some tests to determine the cause. I'll start with the physical examination. *After examination* Everything seems to be normal with the physical examination. Now, let's review your lab results.\nDoctor: Your lab results show that you have anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit at 32.2%, and lipase at 164 U/L. Your comprehensive metabolic panel is unrevealing, so we performed a CT of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a better look.\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed an enlarged pancreas without a focal mass, diffuse surrounding mesenteric edema, mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy, rectal wall thickening with perirectal lymphadenopathy, left renal mass measuring 3.7 × 1.4 × 1.4 cm, right renal mass measuring 2.3 × 4.3 × 5.2 cm, marked diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion. This raised concern for peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or mesenteric tumor.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We wanted to be thorough, so we invited urology and oncology services to evaluate you. They both agreed that a biopsy of the lymph node was necessary, along with urine cytology and HIV testing.\nDoctor: Your urine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes. The renal biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A bone marrow biopsy was also performed and was consistent with involvement of B-cell lymphoma.\nPatient: That's scary. What about the HIV test?\nDoctor: Your HTLV-I/II antibody test came back negative, but your HIV screening was positive. Your initial CD4 count was 440/μl with a percentage of 14%, and your HIV RNA viral load by PCR was 61,800 copies/mL.\nPatient: Oh no. What about hepatitis?\nDoctor: Your hepatitis C virus screening was negative. Your hepatitis B screening showed that you were positive for the core antibody and surface antibody, but negative for the surface antigen.\nDoctor: Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also above the upper limit of detection for our lab, at >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Finally, the biopsy of your kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for other markers.\nPatient: So, what's the plan, doctor? What do we do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to consult with specialists in oncology and infectious diseases to determine the best course of action for your treatment.
