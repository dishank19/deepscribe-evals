What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I've had complaints of microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria for the past 3 years.\nDoctor: I see. How has your creatinine level been during this time?\nPatient: It was within normal range when it was last checked.\nDoctor: Alright. I noticed that we performed a renal biopsy on you. The results showed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus. The immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas. There was also weak but significant IgG deposition in the glomeruli, somewhat different from the distribution of IgA or C3. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of electron-dense deposits in mesangial areas. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: To manage your condition, you were started on antihypertensive therapy, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. However, eight months later, your serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL from 1.04 mg/dL a month before. Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr. We then conducted serological tests to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The tests revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at a titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: After your admission, we initiated treatments with hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 50 mg/day. We performed a second renal biopsy at four weeks after admission to assess the probability of renal recovery and make a final diagnosis. The biopsy revealed cellular to fibrocellular crescents in 18 of 25 glomeruli, excluding six global sclerotic glomeruli. The immunofluorescence study showed linear IgG deposition along the glomerular capillary walls and mesangial staining for IgA.\nPatient: What does that mean for my condition?\nDoctor: The results of the second biopsy, along with your clinical history and lab findings, confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatments as needed to ensure the best possible outcome.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in managing my condition.\nDoctor: You're welcome. It's important to stay on top of your treatment and follow-up appointments.

I've been restricting my eating to lose weight for a few years now.\nDoctor: I see. You were admitted to our hospital twice, the first one in September 2019 when you lost 16 kg over 3-4 months and were weighing 40 kg with a BMI of 16.0 kg/m2.

This led to your discharge. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yeah, I got really jealous of my sister because she was going home after the visit, and I had to stay.
