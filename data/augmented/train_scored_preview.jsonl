{"id": "0", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: My son has been having some issues with speech and development. He's 13 years old now.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\nPatient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.\nPatient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?\nDoctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. \nPatient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?\nDoctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.\nPatient: How long will the treatment last?\nDoctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.\nPatient: Alright, thank you, doctor.\n[After 3 weeks of therapy]\nDoctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.\nPatient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?\nDoctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary.

I see that you are a 60-year-old African American male and currently asymptomatic. I also noticed that your 62-year-old brother had prostate cancer and was successfully treated with radiation. Is that correct?\nPatient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.\nPatient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?\nDoctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.\nPatient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?\nDoctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.\nPatient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?\nDoctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.\nPatient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?\nDoctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.\nPatient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.\nDoctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.\nPatient D: Thank you, doc.
