{"id": "bad-200", "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see from your chart that you are a 66-year-old woman with a significant past medical history of well-controlled hypertension. What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I've had complaints of microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria for the past 3 years.\nDoctor: I see. How has your creatinine level been during this time?\nPatient: It was within normal range when it was last checked.\nDoctor: Alright. I noticed that we performed a renal biopsy on you. The results showed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus. The immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas. There was also weak but significant IgG deposition in the glomeruli, somewhat different from the distribution of IgA or C3. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of electron-dense deposits in mesangial areas. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: To manage your condition, you were started on antihypertensive therapy, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. However, eight months later, your serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL from 1.04 mg/dL a month before. Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr. We then conducted serological tests to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The tests revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at a titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: After your admission, we initiated treatments with hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 50 mg/day. We performed a second renal biopsy at four weeks after admission to assess the probability of renal recovery and make a final diagnosis. The biopsy revealed cellular to fibrocellular crescents in 18 of 25 glomeruli, excluding six global sclerotic glomeruli. The immunofluorescence study showed linear IgG deposition along the glomerular capillary walls and mesangial staining for IgA.\nPatient: What does that mean for my condition?\nDoctor: The results of the second biopsy, along with your clinical history and lab findings, confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatments as needed to ensure the best possible outcome.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in managing my condition.\nDoctor: You're welcome. It's important to stay on top of your treatment and follow-up appointments. If you have any concerns or symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you.\nPatient: Thank you, I will.", "gold_soap": {"S": "66-year-old female with a history of well-controlled hypertension presents with complaints of microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria for the past 3 years.

We've also done an ophthalmoscopic examination of your left eye, and it revealed nothing that could explain your complaints. However, during the follow-up, you developed photopsia in the left eye. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: We also conducted visual field testing, which showed an enlarged blind spot and decreased sensitivity superiorly and nasally.

FFA showed normal appearances in the arteriovenous and late phases in your right eye.

The Psychiatry service was consulted shortly after your admission. Can you tell me more about your mood during that time?\nPatient: Well, my mood was quite low since my brother fell ill about 2 months before that. My antidepressant dose was increased a month before my admission.\nDoctor: I see. So at that time, you were at your baseline mental state, engaging well in conversation and denying any low mood, which was confirmed by the community mental health nurse. No changes were made to your management, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: A week later, the neurology service was asked to review you due to an altered level of consciousness. During the examination, you presented with waxy flexibility, negativism, new onset increased tone of your left arm, posturing, and catalepsy. Your mobility had deteriorated, with selective speech, mute episodes, and poor oral intake noted by medical staff. Does that sound accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly what happened.\nDoctor: The impression was that you were suffering from acute catatonia. An MRI of your brain was performed, and it showed no acute changes. Nasogastric (NG) feeding was established to ensure adequate oral intake. The psychiatry service was again consulted, and they confirmed the diagnosis of acute catatonia. You were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder with catatonia, as per DSM-5. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: A trial of lorazepam was advised for the treatment of catatonia. The dose was titrated to 3 mg per day. How did you respond to the treatment?\nPatient: The treatment worked well for me.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.
